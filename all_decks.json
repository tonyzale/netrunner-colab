I know you'll understand. Gifs are love, gifs are life. <br /><br />\nThis is the runner I brought to the Italian National on November 23/24.<br />\nIt went 4-1 losing only against the spiciest ASA deck I've seen lately (props to @ReinaMoranda and @ChaosIsMe) piloted by @b4ralai, a man who also refined the original list and sold his soul by DROPPING THE TOP CUT IN ORDER TO PLAY CUBE DRAFT on Sunday.<br />\nIt's the result of a year of running playing <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55661\">Apex</a>, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55661\">Pirate Hayley</a> and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56360\">Leela</a>.<br />\nI've been working on different builds since this summer as I felt there was something interesting (apart from all the broken builds with Laamb, Surfer and everything) after an encounter with @pajamieez on jnet, his build is what made me want to explore the id more. <br />\nI even brought <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57359/the-kitty-and-the-laser-raccoon-19th-col-216th-worlds\">an older version</a> to this year's CoL and Worlds and did pretty bad with it while still having some pretty close games.<br />\nI kept on iterating, mixing old and new ideas and came up with this.<br />\nLook, I know the DoFs look weird, but hear me out.<br />\nWhat's the best faction to play Rezeki in? Crim. They deny credits, games go longer, you make a lot of money. Why not slow down the corp playing the only ID you can reliably get 2 Rezekis down turn 1 with?<br />\nLet me show how the game often goes.<br /><br />\nThis is you running away with the corp's credits and agendas.<br /><img data-src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zCY4EJ1VTpo/UjygmT1240I/AAAAAAAAClw/PIuyoqZj4Ew/s1600/raccoonstealscatfood.gif\" alt=\"doofed\" /><br /><br />\nThis is you with your best buddy Hernando waiting for the corp to decide whether they really wanna rez that Slot Machine for 6 (that you break for 2-3 credits anyway) just to get siphoned to 0 a turn later.<br /><img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5K7cWu5Am8Feo/giphy.gif\" alt=\"movie time\" /><br /><br />\nThis is what it feels like you are doing most of the game, as you always try to sneak in with nothing and somehow manage to snatch agendas, trash agendas, trash problem cards, trash your own cards to reinstall them immediately, take them back to hand and put them down again, put them under the deck and fetch 'em again a turn later.<br /><img data-src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qz7D_NCvAl8/T5Q8lV3N92I/AAAAAAAADBg/uISqz1sEThg/s1600/Raccoon_picture_cute_6.jpg\" alt=\"acrobat\" /><br /><br />\nThis is how you look after getting HHN'd on 3 credits (and then getting saved by Rezeki drip + Misdirection from the deck). <br /><img data-src=\"https://i1.wp.com/rangerrick.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/OCT-2014_RaccoonRescue.jpg?fit=1156%2C650&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"tagged\" /><br /><br />\nThis was me getting showered with compliments for the list by my friends.<br /><img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/TvIUvQiqzU3hC/giphy.gif\" alt=\"happy raccoon\" /><br /><br />\nThe deck in itself is pretty tricky and has many ways to get through servers.<br />\nDeus X is super good because Anansi, DNA, FC3, Mausolus are all AP and anything else will be - thanks to the one and only PelangiGod. <br />It also saves you from the occasional Ronin out of IG or snare.<br />\nDeus X + Imp make the IG matchup pretty easy after you know their plan unless your opponent draws the super nuts (just like it happened @ Worlds).<br />\nImp is your tutorable Critic and allows you to keep any asset (or agenda!) spam deck in check while also killing any annoying / weird operation you find. I mean come on people, you know how strong Khumalo is with infinite Imp and Pelangi tokens, I don't have to explain much.<br />\nDon't be afraid to take weird lines in order to get your stuff on the table. There's no shame in starting with \"kab ika, spec work\" just to get to 8 credits for double rezeki t1.<br />\nIf you have to use Scavenge or Rejig early for the kab ability go for Rejig. Remember Scavenge can get you a different program back from the heap, it's not a trivial part of the card. <br />\nI loved the late Armitage addition as sometimes you just need a boost of credits after a remote snipe.<br />\nWhat's better than a whole turn of Mopus clicking?<br />\nI would maybe change the Stimhack for Dorm Computer as you can reload it with Rejig and Data Raven + QPM is annoying.<br />\nYou could also consider Hippo instead of DoF, it even costs 2 for Khusyuk.<br />\nAlso yes, 48 cards baby.\n<br /><br />\nThis is how the days went.<br />\nSwiss:<br />\n- Bye (Regional)<br />\n- Win against 21 agendas Sports (Sid)<br />\n- Loss against Spicy ASA on time (b4ralai)<br />\n- ID (Darta)<br />\n- Win against FA(?)

Let me tell you, it's not the greatest thing even though it's an advantage, at is feels like it takes something away from the win. <br />\nI'm still super happy about how I played and I would've never expected to win the whole thing, don't get me wrong, but it still was unfortunate.<br />\nAs I already pointed out during the stream - I get it. We have small local metas in Italy (biggest one is probably Bologna, 6 people), so these kind of events are rare. Having the chance to play a relaxing format that's a bit different AND with rotated cards is always gonna attract many people.<br /><br />\nThe event was amazing.<br />\n@Atien and @Porkobolo, you handled it incredibly well and we could see how much work you put into this.

Not much to say, the deck is pretty linear.<br />\nScore behind gearchecks early, sometimes jam a couple remotes and score naked agendas, if they keep the tags Exchange to get a Food and remember that Giordano on centrals is often a good idea.<br />\nClose out with Game Changer.<br /><br />\nThis is how the days went.<br />\nSwiss:<br />\n- Bye (Regional)<br />\n- Win against Apoc Val (Sid)<br />\n- Win against Comet Smoke (b4ralai)<br />\n- ID (Darta)<br />\n- Win against Khumalo (Klark)<br /></p>\n\n<p>Top Cut: <br />\n- \"Bye\" win.<br />\n- Win with Runner (Berzelius)<br />\n- Win with Runner (Braverising)<br />\n- Win in the finals vs regular Smoke (Braverising) by hiding a Food in a remote waiting for Game Changer to show up (Clotlock was up). One of the commentators' reaction to that play is what gives this deck its name.\n<br /><br />\nYou can find a couple games <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/polleso_koga/videos\">here</a>.<br />\nAnd <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57834/i-m-master-thief-king-of-swiss-1st-italian-national\">here</a>'s the runner.<br /><br />\nThere was this weird situation where it looked like we were the ones playing Standard side event and the rest were in Cube Draft main event which was a bit weird (with people who managed to make the cut dropping for draft), which resulted in another bye for me in the cut. Let me tell you, it's not the greatest thing even though it's an advantage, at is feels like it takes something away from the win. <br />\nI'm still super happy about how I played and I would've never expected to win the whole thing, don't get me wrong, but it still was unfortunate.<br />\nAs I already pointed out during the stream - I get it. We have small local metas in Italy (biggest one is probably Bologna, 6 people), so these kind of events are rare. Having the chance to play a relaxing format that's a bit different AND with rotated cards is always gonna attract many people.<br /><br />\nThe event was amazing.<br />\n@Atien and @Porkobolo, you handled it incredibly well and we could see how much work you put into this. Thank you so, so much for such great communication before the event, all the prizes you managed to gather (Aurbits, @Atien alt arts, kits, 1st place wooden deck box, ...), the venue (big thanks to Terre Ludiche too!!!) and all the rest.<br />\nThanks to everyone who participated, from veterans to newer players.<br />\nHuge round of applause to @Gwendolf for getting 5th place at his first tournament.<br />\nThanks again to the Torino crew, you know how I feel.<br /><br />\nAlways be \"<a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/PlacidOriginalOrcaDerp\">dio dio dio dio dio dio dio</a>\"ing.<br /></p>\n", "user_id": 4307, "user_name": "Koga", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10067": 3, "10092": 1, "10095": 2, "11019": 2, "21080": 3, "22026": 1, "22027": 2, "22029": 3, "22032": 2, "22033": 2, "25068": 3, "25072": 3, "25079": 3, "25146": 3, "26035": 2, "27004": 3, "06001": 3, "06061": 3, "09009": 3, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57837": {"id": 57837, "date_creation": "2019-11-25T13:30:58+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-28T17:37:34+00:00", "name": "D2D for italian national", "description": "<p>this is a D2D - Aryabhata deck i brought to italian national on 23/24 november.\nI've won all 5 swiss round, 4 by Boom and 1 by scoring.

(1st Place Cambridge, MA GNK, 3-0)", "description": "<p>This deck was undefeated at last week's GNK.  It's inspired by this <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57224/tempo-acme-4-1-col-2019\">Crown of Lasers decklist</a>.  I made a few changes as follows:</p>\n\n<p>-3 <a href=\"/en/card/09026\">GFI</a>\n+2 AR-Enhanced Security\n+2 Degree Mill</p>\n\n<p>I'm not a huge fan of playing GFI, and it never doesn't feel good to score ARES.  Degree Mill is also helpful to keep you ahead if the runner makes a steal.  This agenda suite has two things going for it: 1) you can NA or FA cards with Jeeves, Biotic, and Remastered counters.  I have Biotic --&gt; Jeeves --&gt; Beale/Degree Mill to close out the game several times.  And 2) Beale being over-advanceable gives you a variety of ways to reach 7 points.  Taxing ice combined with relevant assets keeps the runner from checking every remote, which makes you a NA powerhouse.  And scoring an early Remastered or ARES just puts you so far ahead.</p>\n\n<p>-1 Data Ward, -1 Hydra, +1 Architect, +2 Pachinko</p>\n\n<p>Even with the other build's huge economy, rezzing three Data Wards or Hydras is a big ask.  Pachinko is dirt cheap and can be a reasonable deterrent to park in front of a Marilyn, Jeeves, Amani, or even Daily Quest early on.  Architect is just a pet favorite ice of mine in these sorts of decks.</p>\n\n<p>-3 <a href=\"/en/card/06067\">UCF</a></p>\n\n<p>Why would I want to be that guy?  But seriously, I am not a fan of UCF and think it is an obnoxious card.  Also, whenever I would play it, I wound up wishing I had an ETR ice instead.  With enough Aumakua and Engolo around, sometimes you can invalidate an entire server with some bad UCF placement.  I will admit that the deck is probably strictly better with at least 1 UCF, though.  Bonus: The Runner's fear of UCF still benefits you even if you don't slot it.</p>\n\n<p>-1 <a href=\"/en/card/25082\">Ash 2X3ZB9CY</a></p>\n\n<p>I never found myself particularly wanting Ash in a server, although I think having this instead of Architect is a perfectly reasonable choice.  I think part of it was I never wanted to tip the runner off into which remote was the one I planned to score out of.</p>\n\n<p>-1 IPO, +1 Fully Operational, +1 Game Over, +1 EOI</p>\n\n<p>With the influence saved from cutting GFI, we can put in a second fully operational which can really save you in so many situations.  Being able to credit up after crim credit denial or draw through Stargate, getting a well-timed Fully Op off is well worth it.  In addition, on jnet I had some Runners decide to go tag me after being sick of paying for Data Ward and IP Block.  To punish them, I slotted EOI which can let you exchange an early ARES for a hard-stolen Degree Mill or such.  Definitely worth the slot.</p>\n\n<p>Game Over is a fun card that is useful in about 20% of games.  It could probably be changed back to an IPO or another tag punishment in the Liza meta, but occasionally it can be a real blowout and put you so far ahead after a steal that you run away with the game.</p>\n\n<p>I really like this deck in that it has a lot of lines of play and takes advantage of taxing the runner to death while having lots of economy/tempo options.  It feels more like HB than NBN to me in a lot of ways, which I am very much cool with.</p>\n\n<p>Final Thoughts: Please don't play UCF.</p>\n", "user_id": 32441, "user_name": "dnddmdb", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10067": 2, "10092": 1, "11075": 2, "11080": 1, "11094": 3, "12115": 2, "21055": 2, "21076": 2, "21080": 3, "22042": 1, "22046": 2, "23045": 3, "25072": 3, "25080": 1, "25107": 3, "25115": 1, "25143": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 1, "26036": 2, "26047": 3, "26048": 3, "26053": 1, "06061": 1, "08076": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57830": {"id": 57830, "date_creation": "2019-11-24T23:00:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-24T23:23:47+00:00", "name": "Jammy Fastmetal \u201cSteal 5 if you dare!\u201d (3-2, 15th Italia", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://imgflip.com/i/3hfjwi\"><img data-src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/3hfjwi.jpg\" title=\"Megaprix\" alt=\"3hfjwi.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This deck, that went 3-2 in swiss, was one of the only not-combo SM in the Italian National 2019.\nThe 2 losses were a timed loss (1- 2) and a \u201cflooded\u201d loss against 2 adams.\nThe plan is simple.

Post nats, I figured liza was still super busted, but the UK list intrigued me. Being on real breakers, cutting the peddlers, and going to 2x paragon was all stuff worth testing, and I was very lucky to get some important feedback from Mike P, Dyer, Spags and Cavis. I originally included 2x emergency shutdown over legwork, but after some last-minute testing with Kysra, I realized that you desperately needed legwork in the Azmari matchup to even have a chance. </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m just going to cover some changes from my US nats version to this version. I dropped a single game on the day, to a very rushy SSO. </p>\n\n<p>Real breaker suite:</p>\n\n<p>As more people understood how Liza worked, the triple femme suite became measurably worse. I think 1x of all real breakers is the best permutation, and I was really satisfied with them on the day. I played passport over Amina simply because of econ concerns. You\u2019re a centrals pressure deck anyway, and I didn\u2019t find the restriction to be a problem at all. 1 install cost is great!</p>\n\n<p>Cutting Hot Pursuit:</p>\n\n<p>This is another symptom of people understanding how Liza works. With people icing HQ more heavily against me, I found I couldn\u2019t land them as often as I wanted too, and I ended up slotting more dirty laundries to compensate.</p>\n\n<p>Corporate Grant:</p>\n\n<p>This is the busted shit. I didn\u2019t play a restricted card in my original list, but that was a straight mistake. Corporate Grant sings in this list, and you can really put an incredible amount of pressure on the corp. Double dipping with Street Peddlers is great.</p>\n\n<p>Citadel Sanctuary: </p>\n\n<p>With more people on HPT/Self Growth, I needed a way to stay alive. Firstly, Citadel provides clickless tag control, which is great for maintaining tempo. As long as you stay on 3 tags and have four cards in hand, they can\u2019t consult for self growth and HPT you. Secondly, to survive HPT Self Growth in the long run, you need 3 sources of damage prevention on the board.

The game plan is pretty simple as your standard Patchwork MaxX, money up, use Patchwork every turn to threaten any mid to late game scoring. While they bolster their remote, you pivot to Hippoing the R&amp;D ice and Stargating them into oblivion, with ice being the primary target. Levy, rinse, repeat.</p>\n\n<p>This deck absolutely runs over most fair corps with endless D4v1d recursion, can grind with thousand cuts decks and is able to keep asset spam in check. During testing I found the issue matchups happened to be Argus and CtM as those corps are able to tax your clicks so much more than your credits with having to clear tags and only having a limited window in which to do that. A lot of the time I'd find that I'd be able to remote lock an Argus deck, but would have to take a number of tags which was impossible for a standard Anarch deck to clear. The morning of the tournament it hit me, Misdirection is what Shapers use to shore up that matchup, so why couldn't MaxX? We are already running 3 Clone Chips and 3 Inject so it's easy to find it.</p>\n\n<p>This particular build is designed with a more asset heavy meta in mind. If your meta is more glaciery, cut a Hacktivist for a 2nd Stimhack. Another flex slot is the PolOp, I\u2019ve found it to be quite medium. Rebirth might just be better in that slot, but it depends on the meta. The main weakness of the deck is usually the deck itself. If it's unable to find a Patchwork early, or if it draws its programs and bins its economy the deck can seriously stumble.</p>\n\n<p>The day's matchups:</p>\n\n<ol><li><p>IceColdJazz on PE - This game was a grind, but I got lucky and was able to draw into a Wanton twice and bin enough agendas with Stargate and Wanton to win the game after Levying twice. This is a matchup in which patchwork usually doesn't matter, but even though you have 3 passes through your deck, they can still grind you out.</p></li>\n<li><p>CtM - I think this was more or less Spags' US Nats list. I kept an opener with Hacktivist and Inject and rode it to a fairly easy victory as my opponent kept a hand with a bunch of assets and the kill package and couldn't clear Hacktivist, meanwhile I was able to money up and that was all she wrote.</p></li>\n<li><p>ID</p></li>\n<li><p>ID - although Whiteblade111 and I played out this matchup for fun and I would go onto lose that game</p></li>\n<li><p>Political Dealings IG - I got down paired and had to play it out, Hacktivist, Hippo and Stargate locked up the game fairly quickly, although the Corp was a top decked Medical Research Grant away from potentially winning the game.</p></li>\n<li><p>6 Agenda Azmari - Played a very tough game against thike. He was able to open with a turn 1 Scarcity, I wound up drawing through a third of my deck on the first turn before I found a Hacktivist to turn it off. This list is far more reliant on resource economy than some Patchwork lists so turning off Scarcity was priority 1. He was able to rush out an early agenda while I spent a few turns moneying up. His list was playing a full Econ Warfare/HHN/Boom!/Psycho package so running too early could prove to be very costly. I wound up Hippoing his R&amp;D Slot Machine with D4v1d and going ham with Stargate for a few turns, while he HHN'd me a few times, which I was able to clear with the Misdirection. I was able to get to 6 points when he finally got a scoring window. He psyched himself out from installing the winning agenda 2 times while I desperately dug for my singleton Stimhack. Finally he IAAd for the third time and a Stimhack stole the winning Degree Mill.</p></li>\n<li><p>Titan Kill - In the losers bracket. I was able to money up and go ham on R&amp;D with Star Gate, nabbing 2 Atlases and an Oaktown. The corp was able to almost play themselves out from a dire spot by making a what turned out to be a 3 Border Control remote with an advanced GFI. Didn't matter in the end as I was able to nab an agenda with Star Gate.</p></li>\n<li><p>Argus Rush - A rematch of the ID round against Whiteblade111. I mulliganed a pretty bad opener into an even worse opener. Fortunately for me I was able to draw into a Patchwork/Daily Casts to finish off turn 1.  Unfortunately for me, I only saw 1 more Daily Casts after this. My Misdirection came pretty late and after a few Wanton hits and an ill advised Archives run seeing that he was down to 1 CV/1HPT left, had to end the turn on 3 tags while I levied. He had CV in hand and that was all she wrote. Overall I'd say this matchup is normally pretty even. However, against @Whiteblade111, the match up is definitely tough as he is a great pilot with the list, as was shown in the Grand Final.</p></li>\n</ol><p>Overall this deck plays like a cross between Anarch and Shaper. It can be aggressive in certain matchups and it can be controlling in others. It has tools to deal with a wide variety of threats and can pose several threats of its own. Congrats to @Sokka for winning it all, thanks to the Edmonton crew for hosting a great nats, and thanks to @Dragoonkin for providing a great stream set up.</p>\n", "user_id": 25228, "user_name": "yads", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10043": 1, "11042": 2, "11081": 2, "11085": 1, "21103": 2, "25007": 1, "25009": 3, "25010": 2, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "26004": 2, "03035": 2, "03038": 3, "03053": 3, "03054": 3, "06033": 2, "06073": 3, "07029": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 1, "08021": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57780": {"id": 57780, "date_creation": "2019-11-19T14:15:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-21T21:03:17+00:00", "name": "I'm in Love with the Psycho - 3rd at Can Nats", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 25228, "user_name": "yads", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10018": 3, "10054": 3, "10076": 2, "10094": 2, "11016": 3, "11017": 1, "11058": 1, "11080": 3, "11094": 2, "11118": 1, "12115": 3, "21038": 3, "21080": 3, "22044": 1, "22046": 2, "22052": 1, "22058": 1, "25106": 1, "25107": 3, "25108": 3, "25112": 2, "25117": 1, "25118": 1, "25139": 1, "25142": 2, "09013": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57781": {"id": 57781, "date_creation": "2019-11-19T15:19:19+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-19T15:19:19+00:00", "name": "Yeet! - Canadian NISEI Nationals 5th Place", "description": "<p>This was my Corp deck that held out for a 5th Place finish in the 2019 Canadian Nationals.\nI felt it had good matchups against most common runners, and a half-decent shot at beating Liza if I could find a Building Blocks + Chiyashi early enough to give them pause and not let them just run for value all the time. Once a rezed Chyiashi hits the board, the runner must respect all unrezzed ice as Chiyshi and either able to deal with it or not run.<br />\nIt also is a Rig Shooter with Roto/Tithonium + Batty, and Ark Lockdown splash.

Not much to say that hasn't been said about Trash Panda in general, so I'll just highlight a few tweaks I made.\nFirst, Wanton Destruction against most Weyland decks is beautiful. Keeps them off Audacity scores for a while, as well as taking away pieces of HHN+HPT. It's just good against most decks, but in that matchup it's great. Freedom + Imp + Knobie can keep them down, but sometimes getting HQ down to 0 or 1 in a single turn is important.\nI made a last minute change to Hacktivist as another disrupting card, it was important in a few matches to counter Scarcity of Resources. But, take it or leave it. It's a flavor call, not necessary.\nWhat also isn't necessary in this deck is Dirty Laundry. This deck doesn't need a tonnage of credits, and a slot that only nets 3 credits for the risk of running isn't something I'm on board with. Against a HHN+HPT deck, that 3 credit gain miiiiight lure a unwary runner into a situation where they shouldn't have ran in the first place. Against other decks, the econ gain is minor, and the deck slots are better used elsewhere. The value from Knobie + Yusif runs is enough without needing the temptation of making 'oh I just need money' runs as well. \n(I love running corp decks that have plenty of 'If the Runner made a successful run last turn' effects because Dirty Laundry is so often an unthinking auto-include in too many runners minds. It's a trap! Think about your runs people!)</p>\n\n<p>As with my runner decks description, shout out to @bazin for an excellent tournament and everyone who made it to Edmonton!</p>\n", "user_id": 3809, "user_name": "CaKnuckleguy", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11024": 2, "11042": 2, "11081": 1, "21002": 2, "21062": 2, "21068": 1, "21081": 1, "21103": 3, "25007": 1, "25013": 2, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "26004": 1, "26025": 1, "03038": 2, "03046": 1, "03053": 3, "06033": 2, "06073": 3, "07032": 3, "07035": 2, "07038": 1, "08021": 2, "08062": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57783": {"id": 57783, "date_creation": "2019-11-19T18:45:00+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-19T21:00:11+00:00", "name": "Jinja Seidr Rush", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 33846, "user_name": "VarnishingJam", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10037": 3, "11049": 3, "11111": 2, "12029": 2, "12111": 3, "13057": 3, "21031": 3, "21039": 3, "21118": 3, "22029": 2, "23054": 2, "25067": 1, "01110": 3, "01111": 1, "02051": 3, "02110": 2, "04090": 3, "06061": 3, "06111": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57784": {"id": 57784, "date_creation": "2019-11-19T18:45:00+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-19T21:00:07+00:00", "name": "show me what you got", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 33846, "user_name": "VarnishingJam", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11008": 3, "11030": 1, "12104": 3, "21064": 3, "21104": 1, "21106": 3, "25010": 1, "25022": 3, "25026": 3, "25028": 2, "25031": 3, "25059": 3, "25065": 2, "26016": 1, "03053": 3, "05030": 1, "05037": 2, "08067": 3, "08103": 2, "08105": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57786": {"id": 57786, "date_creation": "2019-11-19T21:04:04+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-24T11:04:17+00:00", "name": "University Kit (2nd Place DracheN\u00e4scht, 2-2)", "description": "<p>For the <a href=\"https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/2283/drachenscht-winterturnier-2019\">DracheN\u00e4scht Winterturnier 2019</a> Random ID tournament, I drew Kit from the ID pool and this is the deck that I built and took to 2nd place (15 players total).</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/a8749TBnyEIY8/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Boardstate progression + credit math\" /></p>\n\n<p>I took an Inversificator Kit to Pommes's wonderful deck swap tournament in N\u00fcrnberg earlier this year and he gave me lots of good feedback on it afterwards to help me understand why what I had built was rubbish.</p>\n\n<p>Learning from that, I made the tweaks needed to get the deck working and I decided that I hated it - it needed too many pieces on the board, installing Engolo was expensive and I really missed ProCo but the tempo hit on the install made Kit's ID blank in the early game because I then didn't have enough credits to run.</p>\n\n<p>So instead I decided to try Study Guide and it turns out it's bloomin' amazing when combined with Stimhack and Multithreader, both of which make boosting it easy, cheap and force the Corp to assume you can get into most single-or-double Iced servers once it hits the table.</p>\n\n<p>Initially I was using only Stimhack to push the Study Guide from 0 to 4 in a single run but @CableCarnage suggested Multithreader and it was the piece I needed to complete the puzzle - tutoriable, efficient, versatile and didn't require me to use up precious early clicks in running to utilise it's benefit.</p>\n\n<p>So many cards give you turn after turn of efficiency in this deck and SMC lets you dig up those elusive pieces that ProCo is reluctant to bring forth.  Combined with Kit, you are able to contest from early-mid game and if the Corp takes too long to find their agendas, you can often check any new install-advanced cards in the remote while maintaining your R&amp;D lock into the late game.  The only problem is that against rush decks, there's not much you can do - ProCo is expensive and unless you see SG and Multithreader very early, you have to wait for Rezeki or Kati to give you enough money to start breaking.</p>\n\n<h2>Possible changes:</h2>\n\n<ul><li>This deck definitely needs two Film Critics.

Not much he could have done.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 2 vs Oggbonaion (Tennin Institute: The Secrets Within)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nicholas found Ice, money and two early Obokatas. By the time I was able to contest the remote, I still hadn't found my FC and the Stimhack brain damage was making it hard to steal anything.\nThen I made a stupid mistake and failed to make a successful run, forgetting that would give him all he needed to score the single advanced Obo with his three credits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 3 vs b3ar (NEXT Design: Guarding the Net)</strong></p>\n\n<p>b3ar rushed out early behind three Ice while I was still setting up. He got great draw and there was very little I could do.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 4 vs Hihachu (Weyland Consortium: Building a Better World)</strong></p>\n\n<p>All of Hihachu's agendas were sitting at the bottom of R&amp;D and that gave me time to get my full rig set up, with 2 x RDI, 2 x Rezeki and all my breakers.

Equally running two remotes is completely viable if they can't find the pieces they need to contest and you are drawing into the Ice you need for a second scoring remote.  In such a case, you can jam another DQ in the second remote while you dig to find more agendas to score, getting 6 credits at the start of each turn for doing nothing and keeping the runner guessing about what kill pieces you have in hand.</p>\n\n<h2>Card choices:</h2>\n\n<ul><li>NGO Front: the game nearly always goes to 4 points for you but getting the final 3 is hard. NGO lets you tax the runner out in the remote to create a scoring window. Holding onto a Pre-emptive until you can get an NGO in the bin to shuffle back is a very valid play and running only two NGOs is a wonderful way to keep the runner looking for the third.</li>\n<li>Rashida: This offsets the risk of not finding a DQ in your opening hand to allow you to find one in the first few turns.  Turn one you nearly always want to set up a remote with either Rashida or a DQ.</li>\n<li>Navi: this deck is weak to Shapers once they set up because there just isn't enough Ice to tax the remote and also secure R&amp;D. The Navi gives you a way to limit that and is still relevant for limiting Turning Wheel, Pelangi, SMC, Datasucker or Logic Bomb runs.</li>\n<li>Pri-sec: I started this deck with 3 copies but eventually found that one was all I needed. Putting this in the remote alongside the Daily Quest or an agenda goes a surprisingly long way in Sync.</li>\n</ul><h2>Possible changes:</h2>\n\n<ul><li>None that I can think of. If you have any suggestions I would be very keen to hear them :)</li>\n</ul><h2>Round breakdown:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 1 vs Vesper (The Foundry: Refining the Process)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Vesper got off to a strong start but his money dried up towards the end while I was still rolling in DQ credits. R&amp;D had been very kind to me and kept agendas from both of us while giving me lots of time to set up and eventually score out without too many problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 2 vs Oggbonaion (Reina Roja: Freedom Fighter)</strong></p>\n\n<p>My only defence against Apoc was 2 x Crisiums and smart play, both of which I failed to find in this match.  Nicholas outplayed me very impressively and while I certainly made a few mistakes that he was kind enough to point out to me after the game, I think my reliance on keeping DQ on the table and having a good credit lead on the runner to execute my plan made this a terrible match up for my deck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 3 vs b3ar (Khan: Savvy Skiptracer)</strong></p>\n\n<p>b3ar took an early Degree Mill but I NGOed him onto an 8 strength Surveyor that killed his tempo. His Bukhgalters must have been feeling shy that round because they refused to come out and R&amp;D kept me safe while I scored out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>- Round 4 vs Hihachu (Ken \"Express\" Tenma: Disappeared Clone)</strong></p>\n\n<p>I got near perfect draw against Ken by turn three - DQ ticking away in the remote with a HHN, Boom and Archived Memories all in hand. Hihachu finished turn 4 on 5 creds after having whiffed R&amp;D while I had 12 in the bank and 3 at the start of the turn to pump the HHN trace and kill with Boom the following turn.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>A huge thank you to @met4 for organising the tournament and letting me stay with them; to @lukenukem for the incredible pumpkin soup and testing games leading up to the event; to @cablecarnage for the deck advice and tips that ultimately turned my weak-ass deck into something that did pretty well; and to all my lovely opponents throughout the day.

Expecting to see alot of Stargate and Turning wheel accesses, I figured Snare was not gonna land as much as I wanted it to, So for 4 less credits and 1 less hit you can run Breached Dome and recur it as often as possible into the deck. Also News Team as a feelbad card, helped make each access as painful as possible. There isn't much for tag punishment but the ability to trash a film critic if they float tags is worth it. There is a singleton Closed Accounts as a slap to any Tag me Runners that I came across.\n\n<p>First matchup was against Hayley Stargate, I rused them into running the psychic field after they dieseled up turn 1 which set them back alot then managed to get a couple key scores of Chronos Project to remove the clot from the equation and some breakers.</p>\n\n<p>Second matchup was against Good stuff Valencia. they were running aumakua, and to build up counters they kept running my HQ with Mwanza City Grid, eventually giving me over 100 credits.

With Knobkerie it just made sense to then include an Imp to help contest assets or combo pieces.</p>\n\n<p>First matchup against Building a Better World I managed to set up really quick and pull some quick early accesses and recover from SDS Drone score before breakers got Ark Lockdown</p>\n\n<p>Second Matchup was against Argus, which was everywhere during nats. I got out Imp turn 1 and contested an unprotected HQ with everything I had. Film critic was crucial here and absolutely the best Unicorn in the meta for most decks.</p>\n\n<p>Third matchup against Aginfusion I managed to get into a server without a barrier breaker with 2 barriers and 2 nisei counters, by overwriting pelangis with clonechips. It was a highlight for the day and a good proof of concept.</p>\n\n<p>Overall the econ was short. I would put in some Stimhack and maybe give up a deuces wild or Peace in our time. Although I never forced the clot it was always left within arms reach and I'm sure it helped a ton with the amount of purges it got.</p>\n\n<p>This was a fun deck idea to craft and play with.

(Credit to <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/21556/Zerothmaxima\">@Zerothmaxima</a> for this high level content)</p>\n\n<p>The is the list I used that went undefeated to win Canadian Nationals alongside a <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57764/programs-that-grow-1st-place-canadian-nationals-\">Self-Growing Corp deck</a>. Since my <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56017/raccoon-tech-1st-place-calgary-regionals-\">Racoon Tech</a> got hit with the removal of Laamb, I had no idea what runner to play when testing for Canadian Nationals. I tried Reg 419, Reg Val, Swift Val, and Apoc Alice a lot but I realized that I\u2019m just naturally a Shaper player. I also realized that it costs a whole click and 2 credits just to remove 1 tag and WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THAT!? ProCo/Pawnshop Hayley was basically the only shaper floating around but I have a huge dislike for ProCo because installing it usually gives the Corp a ticket to score an agenda. So I turned to an adapted Kabo list with normal breakers before realizing that Smoke just does everything better. It was a very diverse meta on the day with many different types of decks. I like to play flexible decks (so basically Shaper) so I like the way that turned out. I was actually the only Smoke as well. </p>\n\n<p>The main game plan is to get a Paragon installed ASAP and then start playing Dirty Laundry on open servers once per turn. Once you get a Net Mercur out and start doing the above while also pumping a breaker for free Net Mercur credits then it becomes very difficult for the Corp to stop you. Turning Wheel and Kyuban is a sick combo. If you can spend 4 clicks gaining 8 credits and 4 Turning Wheel counters then you\u2019re in an amazing spot. </p>\n\n<p>That\u2019s the general idea but if anyone has questions about anything please ask in the comments and I\u2019d be more than happy to provide specific responses there!</p>\n\n<p>The deck was shown on stream against PE during round 3, against <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/11664/Whiteblade111\">@Whiteblade111</a>\u2019s Argus in the winner\u2019s finals, and again against the same Argus in game 2 of the grand finals. Here is <a href=\"https://m.twitch.tv/videos/509190928\">a limited time link to the VOD</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I was told after the tournament that I took over the record for the youngest Netrunner national champion after <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/11664/Whiteblade111\">@Whiteblade111</a> held it for all of two weeks after his victory at U.S. Nats. That sounds like a decent record I'm quite happy with! </p>\n\n<p>MUST READ Highlight of the tournament: I was playing my Argus vs <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/11400/goodknite\">@goodknite</a>\u2019s Stealth Wu when he asks if he can use the \u201cExpose 1 piece of ice, then make a run\u201d ability on Deuces Wild if there is no unrezzed ice on the board to expose. I said yes but we decided to check it with a judge. Both judges weren\u2019t sure and after 5 minutes almost everyone at the tournament was crowding over our table with a fairly even split of \u201cyes you can\u201d and \u201cno you can\u2019t\u201d answers. Somebody suggests that we should ask Dan D\u2019Argenio about it since he created the card. So Dien pulls out his phone, calls Dan, and puts his phone in the middle of our table on speaker. Dan picks up, he\u2019s told the scenario we are in, and is then asked if selecting the 4th choice is allowed. Dan\u2019s response on speaker with everyone listening: \u201c......that\u2019s a good question\u201d. Then Dan goes on and gives a \u201cbased on my understanding of the game\u201d answer saying that he believes the answer is yes and then explains why. We then got a response from one of the NISEI rules managers confirming that the answer is yes.</p>\n\n<p>Huge huge shoutout to <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/29584/Bazin\">@Bazin</a> for running a smooth tournament and hooking us up with some sweet extra swag!

Despite going 15-0 on jnet during testing, up until the day before the tournament I was actually going to play AgInfusion for various reasons such as a personal preference for glacier decks. So basically, a special shoutout goes to <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/19376/smilingo\">@smilingo</a> for convincing me to play this over that AgInfusion deck during our little testing session the evening before the tournament. I believe his advice was \u201cif you want to mess around then play AgInfusion, but if you want to win, play Weyland\u201d, and what great advice that was. </p>\n\n<p>On the day it only lost one game to <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/11664/Whiteblade111\">@Whiteblade111</a>\u2019s Liza during game 1 of grand finals, but in addition to missing what should have been an obvious lethal, there were many other major misplays, game-state errors, and mistakes by both players during that match. I think anyone who has seen it is on the boat of \u201clet\u2019s forget that whole game ever happened\u201d and for those of you that haven\u2019t watched it.........probably don\u2019t :D</p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing about Argus was deciding what to cut for the Self-Growth Program. I was trying out <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/16870/Slowriffs\">@Slowriff</a>\u2019s agenda suite from <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57162/only-death-is-real-belgian-nationals-6th\">Only Death Is Real - Belgian Nationals 6th</a> and I liked it quite a bit, so I just used the GFI influence for the SGP instead of having to cut Hard-Hitting News and a Data Raven. I think Veritas is my secret pet card. The first 2 subs basically pays for the 4 rez cost and then the 3rd sub is just a bonus. At the very least it costs the most efficient breakers 3 credits, which is still great for a 4 cost ice. I've seen many Argus players either discard or install but not rez their Archer(s) so I think Veritas makes a lot of sense, especially in a build with 2 Hostile Takeovers. Argus needs a good early ice for early facechecks besides Mausolus anyways. Whether or not it\u2019s good with the perceived heavy presence of Liza is a different discussion. </p>\n\n<p>If anyone has questions about anything please ask in the comments and I\u2019d be more than happy to provide specific responses there! </p>\n\n<p>Huge huge shoutout to <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/29584/Bazin\">@Bazin</a> for running a smooth tournament and hooking us up with some sweet extra swag!

Won a Store Champ, Won Edmonton Regionals, 2nd Calgary Regionals, and 5th at Canadian Nationals where my corp failed me twice in top8.  It's the only deck I ever felt the need to publish.</p>\n\n<p>In a world where your opponent doesn't know Apocolypse exists this deck is a blowout, but most of the time you don't need the element of surprise.  Setting up DDOS/Apoc and being blatant about it is totally fine, it will give the Corp lots of time to frantically double ice servers and forget to score points.  Most of our time is going to be spent making money, drawing into our combo or running open servers.  It's so annoying when I have to actually install ice breakers and I typically prefer not to waste my time doing that unless I have to.  In over 50% of games you WILL land Apoc because it's such a focused plan.  This is not a backup plan, this is our plan A.</p>\n\n<p>The Spice</p>\n\n<p>Hippo\nGreat when they have a single iced central you want to threaten before or after an Apoc to force them to re-ice it 1 deep so you can DDOS Apoc it later.</p>\n\n<p>Turning Wheel\nThis is often our after apoc win condition, but it will also help if Apoc is shutdown and we need to stack counters for 1 final run.  This can be a 2 of if you want.</p>\n\n<p>Bhagat\nThis is an optional card, but It forces the Corp to reinforce HQ in games when they dont want to.  It can be used pre-apoc to force out ICE or post Apoc to try to win faster.</p>\n\n<p>Run Amok\nThis is basically Inside Job and used to get into Remote Servers we wouldn't have time for otherwise.  Especially annoying if you use it with DDOS.</p>\n\n<p>DDOS\nThe obvious use of this is landing the Apoc, but it can also be used for any turn you want to get in 4 easy runs without spending a lot of money.</p>\n\n<p>Makers Eye\nThis is just my current alternative to a second Turning Wheel.</p>\n\n<p>Utopia Shard is a cute option too in this list.</p>\n", "user_id": 19376, "user_name": "smilingo", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10085": 1, "10098": 1, "11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11081": 3, "12061": 1, "21103": 1, "25006": 1, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25046": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 3, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "07032": 3, "07035": 1, "07036": 2, "08021": 3, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57754": {"id": 57754, "date_creation": "2019-11-17T19:13:49+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-19T20:27:32+00:00", "name": "MaxX NuSalt edition", "description": "<p>A simple Patchwork MaxX I took to a 6-people event. </p>\n\n<p>Day Job could be Stimhack to make it faster.

They chose nasir, and i tried to make a nasir deck work and it Didn't; but it lead me to finding a couple of Apoca-lat decks that were <em>really</em> interesting, mostly <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57354/latpocalypse-4-1-crown-of-lasers\">this one.</a>  I decided to switch to that for my dumbass needs.</p>\n\n<p>I played around with it a bunch and realized it aws the perfect place to go <em>way too hard</em> on engolo, and then rebirth into <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/03028\"> a cute cyborg girl.</a>  Very, very few ice walls can stand up to a surprise kit + engolo.  </p>\n\n<p>For those of you unaware how this deck works, you draw a ton of your deck with diesels/deuces/just plain old Click To Draw which you can do with extra clicks you get off beth + peace in our time/playing 2 events a turn with Comet.  Throw away every Out Of The Ashes you draw, usually by discard but occasionally by playing it. </p>\n\n<p>Eventually, you've drawn into apocalypse and you have 2-3 OotA in your bin; you can now pull them out to make runs before your turn begins and have 3-5 actions to play your apoc.  It's gives you a lot of wiggle room, I've had turns where i played clone chip click 1 run click 2 apoc click 3, just to make sure that i had the breakers i needed to get in.  </p>\n\n<p>The breaker suit is mostly just engolo, but Cerberus is great because you won't be breaking things more then a few times a game, and ika is just A Good Breaker especially when you're only going for a few servers.  Pelangi helps when you can't get in, misdirection helps you Not Die, and equivocation was a last second add i'm not sure about.</p>\n\n<p>Encore is actually here as a secret tech against punitives/hhn/other post-apoc, and for turns where you don't wanna run archives immediately after apoc-ing because you're a scaredy cat.  give yourself a whole extra turn to prepare.</p>\n\n<p>Rebirth is for turning into girls.</p>\n\n<p>Okay like, specifically it's for turning into Kit so you can then get into servers more easily and apocalypse faster.  However, it's occasionally not a bad idea to turn into Jesmender if the opposing deck is like, super tag heavy; i don't think you'd turn into anyone else.  If you turn into kate you've violated the spirit of the deck and i have no respect for you.  </p>\n\n<p>The goal if this deck is to eventually have a turn where all 3 of your central server runs happen before your turn begins, and thus you can play Peace In Our Time, play Apocalypse with comet, play Encore, Notoriety, Notoriety, and then use your final beth click to run archives.  If you can do this please take a picture of it, I want to see.</p>\n\n<p>If you win this deck without playing rebirth you have won the game, but not the moral victory, and I pity you.</p>\n", "user_id": 34254, "user_name": "JuniperTheory", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10080": 5, "10083": 1, "11008": 2, "11030": 2, "11084": 1, "11085": 1, "11107": 1, "11109": 3, "21108": 3, "22019": 1, "25042": 3, "25044": 2, "25059": 3, "26019": 1, "26025": 1, "03038": 3, "03046": 3, "03053": 3, "03054": 2, "06099": 1, "08027": 2, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57741": {"id": 57741, "date_creation": "2019-11-15T21:34:47+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-17T16:41:49+00:00", "name": "The Art of Intrusion 103: Breaking stuff", "description": "<p><em>\"Welcome back, students.

After some testing, I settled on a Leela deck before realising that someone on my PoS team was Leela already! So, I borrowed Andy's \"Cowards\" Liza deck the night before PoS (Everyone else called it that, not me! Well, until 2 games in). In PoS, I won 3 games and could have won a 4th if I hadn't been so focused on using Apocalypse on a combo Sports deck after stealing 6 points...</p>\n\n<p>It went so well that I asked Andy to let me take it to Nats. Sadly I fared worse in the main event, losing twice to Argus, drawing against a 3rd and going tag-me FAR TOO SOON against CtM. The only game I won in the main event was against a Palana deck that was just severely flooded with agendas. Liza had a game off against Azmari due to an unfortunate game loss for my opponent.</p>\n\n<p>My thanks to Andy for letting me use this deck! I also want to thank Mick for being the driver on a very wet drive to Sheffield and thanks also to Dave who was also on our team. It was great fun.

Caldera sucks and polop at least shoots rashida so it\u2019s never blank\u201d - Chris Dyer - 8th November</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhat idiot put this Polop in this deck?\u201d - Chris Dyer as it came down and locked both of his remaining win cons during the final - 10th November</p>\n\n<p>This deck went through a bit of an odd journey for us, we were very vaguely aware that @whiteblade111 had played it to some success during Crown of Lasers, but didn\u2019t take it super seriously on the grounds that Argus was still pretty popular and while you have a crushing rig against them, it sounded like it would take some fiddly set up that had to fail a relatively high percent of the time. We were also all a little wary of Liza generally having watched a lot of full tag me Liza games against Mti and Palana that looked like mega grinds with turtle being purged that none of us were really into. As such it stayed on the back burner until, I believe, @shipmentofheadcrabs posted a screenshot of a game they were playing with Argus vs Liza on uk slack asking how they were ever supposed to win against the rig as it stood.</p>\n\n<p>Some curiosity tweaked I started pulling this list together from then and beat a few jnet luminaries on both Crisium Grid Palana and Argus. From there I was sufficiently convinced that it was the real deal and passed it onto the rest of the team. @binarydogs and @chrisferg both did a large amount of testing in the Brighton channel and seemed pretty convinced, while team Party House didn\u2019t jump fully on board until after US nationals when two different builds of the deck crushed the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>The initial development process didn\u2019t make a ton of iterations to the build, other than adding the shutdowns and the additional copies of the breakers. While those (particularly the breakers) look a little out of place as non-resources and dead in duplicates/dead against the Asa that we believed to be the best corp they both proved particularly important in lifting up the Blue Sun rigshooter matchup that we expected to be reasonably popular. Previously an explosive start out of that deck could cause Aumakua huge problems and Batty + Tithonium/Chiyashi could completely end the game whereas that lifted our econ denial game high enough and gave us both a better chance at beating gear checks + additional programs to chuck to Dummy Box in the face of program trash.</p>\n\n<p>From there it became a particularly interesting meta question: would the deck go entirely under the radar, had the US nats victory and all the discussion on Slack pushed too many people to play egregious hate for the deck (I doubt that the card Self Growth Program has ever been searched for on slack as many times in one day as it was that Monday) or would it go to the next level and would people assume that between the 1 week prep time between the two events and the wide discussion of SGP mean that there would be no Liza so there would be no need to then actually play the hate.</p>\n\n<p>In practice the deck felt strong enough to theoretically have a non-zero chance of beating the hate decks while crushing everything else. We decided to go for it and just cross our fingers that we weren\u2019t making a terrible terrible mistake and we all sleeved it up. The final part of The Process undertaken in the house on the Friday night prior to the Swiss once @nemamiah, @vinegarymink and @tolaasin were on board involved locking in 46 cards then all staring at 2 copies of Aeneas Informant, a Paragon and a Caldera for an entire hour while listening to increasingly terrible radio. Finally we agreed to go with:</p>\n\n<ul><li>1 x Inside Job to marginally improve your rush matchup (particularly as we believed that the already bad SGP Argus matchup tanked to about 5% if they got an Atlas counter and that they would probably try and jam one through before Aumakua came down)</li>\n<li>1 x Political Operative as a broad hate card (killing Ronin against PE/IG, Lakshmi and Recoco against Asa, La Costa and Crisium against Palana and Rashida against basically everything)</li>\n<li>1 x Same Old Thing as a compromise between an additional IJ, Shutdown or as an additional Doof/Corp Grant</li>\n<li>The third The Class Act</li>\n</ul><p>then put it all away and played some Fastro vs Prepaid Kate.</p>\n\n<p>On the day 17 people were on various flavours of Liza, including 5 people on this exact 50 cards (significantly more people than did, in the end, play strong hate). In total it didn\u2019t actually wildly overperform, the % progression into the cut was about in line with the % of the field and the id was distributed throughout the standings. That said, between myself and Chris I believe it dropped 2 games all weekend and it felt very strong in most of the others, including a game I managed to take against a fully teched out Self Growth Program Argus (by controlling the tags at 2 for the first 6 turns until I got to 4 points then loading up on tags from a data raven and seeing 7 cards out of r&amp;d) with hq relatively clean.</p>\n\n<p>Overall the weekend was fantastic and I feel incredibly privileged to be part of the UK Netrunner community which is the best group of random internet friends you could possibly ask for to spend a weekend locked in a game shop playing a children\u2019s card game with.

After discarding EOI Azmari (because the games were too long), Boom CtM (so close to tempo CtM but so far away) and Argus (because it felt just about okay at worlds and cutting good cards from it for Self Growth to beat the growing Liza threat just felt sad) we were left with Asa.</p>\n\n<p>The list that had been going around the UK pre-worlds derived from [Unban CI You Cowards] still felt okay but we assumed there would be a fair amount of apoc and hacktivist at nats and that combined with mine and @binarydogs\u2019 love of combos pushed us towards Pinsel\u2019s [world\u2019s winning Recoco combo deck] which had a better chance of still putting a win together once it\u2019s board got blown away. A couple of days prior to the event @nemamiah asked me for the final cut of the list and in the end I believe 4 of us played it on the day.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously very little here has changed from Pinsel\u2019s original list so I\u2019ll only really go through the minor changes we made:</p>\n\n<p>-1 CVS, +1 Lakshmi</p>\n\n<p>Despite the success the deck had at world\u2019s, we didn\u2019t expect there to be much Freedom at nationals. There was also relatively little discussion going on about needing to respect it so we didn\u2019t expect shapers to be packing Imp which really only left CVS as a non-tutorable Clot answer that very occasionally bought you expensive Hagen blowouts against Aumakua. Given the relative lack of Imp and Critic we found that Lakshmi fulfilled a similar purpose against Clot while also giving you a significantly easier time assembling a 3 turn score plan (rush the effcom, lakshmi the pv, combo the gfi) that didn\u2019t rely on playing a Biotic Labor against denial heavy criminal decks.</p>\n\n<p>-1 Archived Memories, +1 Restore</p>\n\n<p>This one I believe I first saw when playing against @mcbeast on jnet and decided it was pretty smart. You lose a little bit of flexibility in being able to recur Fully Operationals or Dedication Ceremonies multiple times but you gain in several places that add up quite quickly. Firstly, I found that quite a lot of players were adopting a strategy involving heavily attacking your Cybernetics Courts to the exclusion of a lot else. While that line doesn\u2019t seem amazing it could occasionally case you real problems. Restore being a single click to get a court back simplified the recovery because you can draw 3 times with Jeeves, see if you hit the second court and if not Restore it back onto the board and keep moving.</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, it improves a fair number of your combo lines by making it easier to trigger Jeeves or by giving you a 1 click Recoco install from the bin that doesn\u2019t rely on a Vitruvius counter. As before, these things started to become particularly important when playing against denial heavy, aggressive criminal decks like Liza that sniped the Recoco from a central, being able to Restore, DC, DC, then install the agenda with the Jeeves click without being forced to play a biotic is a lot more plausible off a low credit pool (and without forcing you to give up the second DC for counters).</p>\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a line in the opposite kind of game where you have a ton of money but no real board state (particularly no Jeeves) where it improves your odds of getting the 5 point combo off with a piece missing. Having access to a Restore to get the Recoco out of the bin for the second score allows you to use one of your PV counters to play another Biotic Labor (also useful in the case that you do have Jeeves but have already been forced to use the counter to play a value FO or save a gated agenda from a Mad Dash).</p>\n\n<p>Overall on the day I think all of us found the deck to be fundamentally \u201cokay\u201d, as expected the heavy presence of Aumakua Corporate Grant decks and Apocalypse + people aggressively pushing the board made it difficult to assemble any ideal combo wins and meant the majority of games came down to a scrappy combination of mini combos, Lakshmi scores, cheeky jams behind Gatekeeper and clicking for credits under Corporate Crant. The 3 Liza/Asa games Chris and I played against each other were probably indicative of the fact that if the Liza deck remains playable and the people on it have a solid enough understanding of how Asa works then this isn\u2019t the correct corp pick, but on the day and into the meta that was present it was just about good enough to get carried there by a particularly absurd runner.</p>\n\n<p>Overall the weekend was fantastic and I feel incredibly privileged to be part of the UK Netrunner community which is the best group of random internet friends you could possibly ask for to spend a weekend locked in a game shop playing a children\u2019s card game with.

In order to do some last-minute testing I brought both these decks to the President of Servers team event on the Friday. After facing exclusively Crims on <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a> and Anarchs with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>/<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a>, and a lengthy discussion in the Cambridge group, I made the following changes:</p>\n\n<p>-1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a> +1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25130\">Archer</a></p>\n\n<p>Going into Worlds the UK Argus players suggested dropping the 2nd <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25130\">Archer</a> for an <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a>, giving you an additional out in the late game with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a> + <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a> shenanigans as well as being useful against <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09030\">Apocalypse</a> decks. While having the extra line of play can be comforting, I found it underwhelming in the PoS team tournament due to the prevalence of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>, and the expectation that nearly every deck would have access to an answer - <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a>, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21108\">Engolo</a>, or <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/07040\">Eater</a>. I therefore brought back the 2nd copy of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25130\">Archer</a>. I (incorrectly) expected Freedom to be popular at the event after placing 1st and 2nd at Worlds, and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25130\">Archer</a> is extremely powerful in that matchup, while being a face-check threat that all runners have to respect.</p>\n\n<p>-1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25133\">Hortum</a> +1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a></p>\n\n<p>If I could include 6 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11097\">Mausolus</a> in this deck, I would. Sadly NISEI has neglected to errata <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11097\">Mausolus</a> to be consumer-grade thusfar. <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25133\">Hortum</a> has always felt bad to me, as every time I have drawn/installed/ressed it I have wished it were <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11097\">Mausolus</a> instead. One of my takeaways from Worlds was the power of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a> on HQ - especially against <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11042\">Black Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21103\">Hippo</a>. I therefore wanted to more reliably draw it early. <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a> also fills the role of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25133\">Hortum</a> as a gearcheck on the remote in certain situations - although it is significantly weaker against <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>. As your plan usually involves a mix of 1-2 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25112\">Data Ravens</a> and 1-2 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/28005\">Border Controls</a> on the remote, I decided that this trade-off was worth the consistency of drawing <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As I did not have much time to prepare I was completely unaware of the new Dummy Box Liza deck until the day before the event. At this point it was too late to switch away from Argus, so the choice was whether to make space for <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21016\">Self-Growth Program</a>. After discussing this with the Cambridge group we decided that slotting it would weaken the other match-ups too much, and while I expected the deck to be played I did not expect it to be massively popular. This turned out to be completely wrong, as 17 out of 65 players were on Liza, but I managed to dodge the matchup the entire Swiss and Top cut until the loser's final - better lucky than good!</p>\n\n<p>In the end this deck went 5-3, losing to RotomAppliance's 419 twice and Chris Dyer on Liza once, and my <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57279/compilation-hayley\">runner deck</a> went 7-1.

(13th at UK Nats, 5-1)", "description": "<h1>In the Grim Darkness of 2019 There is Only #WarhammerWednesday</h1>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uJRzPv1.jpg?1\" alt=\"Sweet Alt Art ID from HerbartKlopstock\" title=\"ID by HerbartKlopstock\" /></p>\n\n<p>After Worlds I began to think about UK Nats and what decks I might bring to it.</p>\n\n<p>Then I did no practice and so decided the day before that I would just play my Worlds decks again and hope that the jig wasn't completely up on kill Azmari.</p>\n\n<p>I made one change to my worlds list which was swapping the one-off IPO that I played only a couple of times for a Psychographics to use vs Liza without going full Self-growth tech. </p>\n\n<p>I didn't use the psycho at all but with two consulting visits the theory is sound I think. You can usually try for an early score if Liza is expecting kill and controlling tags until the dummybox and paparazzi show up and echo chamber often goes unchecked.</p>\n\n<p>The EOI lists and the scarcity version of the kill list both may be better vs Liza.</p>\n\n<h1>The Event</h1>\n\n<p>The deck did me proud on the day, only dropping one game. My runner was again <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57401/mixtape-for-the-street-sweepers-20th-at-worlds-4-1-col-un#\" title=\"So many rotating cards\">Mixtape for the Street Sweepers</a> as Hayley is getting massively changed by rotation and I wanted one last ride with the classic cards.</p>\n\n<p>Round 1 - vs Rahrhino (Fear the Masses Gnat and Chronos Protocol) <strong>WW</strong></p>\n\n<p>Gnat was a classic case of trying to work out what the deck's plan was and then rapidly icing up HQ. I managed to score out without getting milled.</p>\n\n<p>Chronos was a bit of a worry as I had decided that I had no need for the costly Feedback Filter just the night before and the early turns involved several mushined cards. I ran what I thought was correct, getting Fetal's both times on a first click which let me draw up after and keep me safer from complete image. Stargate eventually found me a winning Obokata.</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 - vs Chris Dyer (Combo Asa and Counter-Surveillance Liza) <strong>WL</strong></p>\n\n<p>I knew that Chris was aware of my deck and that the jig was up so I unhid my alt art and proceeded to go for my 'try to score 4 points quickly plan'. Fortunately for me despite him getting 3 paparazzi early he was unable to find a dummy box and I was going for the winning agenda when he made a counter-surveillance dig for just 3 cards which fortunately missed.</p>\n\n<p>Hayley gave me none of the cards I really wanted to see vs Asa - no Astrolabe, no Paricia and no Aesop's. Chris quickly scored an Effcom from the table and scored out in fairly short order.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 - vs Ronan (Liza and Fast Advance plus La Costa Palana) <strong>WW</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another Liza and run by a friend from the Edinburgh meta so once again... the jig was up. The game progressed with me again trying for early score before Ronan got set up to start accumulating tags but then he made a misplay ending a turn with dummy box but no paparazzi and 3 tags so I was able to consulting-Boom.</p>\n\n<p>Palana got off to a good start but Hayley then accelerated and I was able to keep the remote contested and eventually Stargate the winning points</p>\n\n<p>Round 4 - vs Andrew Wright (Blue Sun and Valencia) <strong>LW</strong></p>\n\n<p>Seeing Valencia I immediately suspected Apoc and then proceeded to not play to my usual apoc plan. Prisecs went in the remote instead of on archives (Stargate and Wanton for zero clicks both can stop them on the centrals) and I lost a big chunk of my ice to the first Apoc. Never managed to stabilise and then slowly bled points - runner didn\u2019t ever go poor enough to be vulnerable to Econ Warfare HHN.</p>\n\n<p>Blue Sun was a hefty game, lots of big ice that slowly ate through my resources. I got to 5 points with the corp on 3 and then he install double advanced just before time was called. I checked the remote and established I wouldn't get in through the Border Controls and so took a run at R&amp;D where I top decked the winning SDS.</p>\n\n<p>Round 5 - vs Filip (Outfit and Leela) <strong>LW</strong></p>\n\n<p>This game was on stream so I got to show off my lovely banana shirt and my mascot <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/JrBDsbg.jpg\" title=\"Sportshopper\">Sportshopper</a>. I kept what I thought was a pretty good opener with Tech Writers to get me started economically but Filip was able to get two City Works scored using dedication ceremony and the threat of punitive to keep me away from them. I got Stargate set up but then didn't also progress my rig enough and I wasn't able to challenge the winning SSL in a double Border Control plus Bulwark remote.</p>\n\n<p>In the return game I got set up with low credits and put an NGO in my remote with a prisec after Filip Special Ordered for Engolo. The following turn was install Engolo, Doof through IP Block then last click run the remote and I was able to take NGO credits and fire Prisec. My following turn was trash a Kati, Econ Warfare and HHN then the next turn after two tags were cleared I install double advanced another NGO. Filip left it suspecting a QPM and cleared down to two tags and I got the Consulting-Boom.</p>\n\n<p>Round 6 - vs Ben (Argus and 419) <strong>LW</strong></p>\n\n<p>Final round I felt reasonably confident with a decent starting money hand for Argus but lacking tutors. After Ben scored a two counter Atlas I started to panic and play a bit too loosely and I eventually ran an unadvanced Oaktown click 3 through a Data Raven and took that plus a Prisec tag then 2 meat. I cleared one tag but 2 cards in hand meant double HPT finished me.</p>\n\n<p>419 went similarly to the previous round vs Leela. Ben took a cautious start then got set up with a Paragon and Pad Tap. A run on archives left him with 7 credits and I fired a Rashida to trigger Pad Tap and then double Econ Warfare HHN and followed up with the Boom.</p>\n\n<p>All in all a very fun weekend of Netrunner and the classiques matches on Sunday were also a blast despite me going 0-4 before dropping for some Chaos in the Old World which can be summed up with the following image:</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Tk1AqnJ.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks Wil!\" title=\"Thanks Wil for the Pic!\" /></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all my opponents who were lovely and to everyone who came and made the event such good times!</p>\n", "user_id": 5660, "user_name": "E.J.Olmos", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 2, "11016": 3, "11040": 3, "11058": 1, "11080": 1, "11094": 3, "21015": 2, "21036": 2, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21054": 1, "21055": 3, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "23045": 3, "25079": 1, "25112": 3, "25118": 1, "25143": 1, "25146": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57683": {"id": 57683, "date_creation": "2019-11-11T21:04:59+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-14T09:12:38+00:00", "name": "Quest Aginfusion - 5th at UK Nats, 1st at PoS", "description": "<p>A straightforward enough Aginfusion deck. While the ID ability is very powerful, Aginfusion is notoriously poor economically, and the build attempts to remedy this by dedicating 17 slots to economy. </p>\n\n<p>The deck plays the typical Jinteki taxing ice splashes, with Eli not used due to having no teeth when booped into. Not playing 3 Border Control is unusual, but the Daily Quests were valuable and I didn't want to compromise on the cheap value ice. </p>\n\n<p>I chose Aginfusion as I think it's well placed in a meta full of Liza with some apocalypse decks still running around. Crisium Grid seems excellent at the moment, helping to defend against potential Doofs, Hot Pursuits, Embezzles, Counter-Surveillance, Apocalypse, Stargate and Khusyuk. I didn't play that many practice games, but I was beating Liza most of the time, while having plenty of game against Freedom and various shapers. </p>\n\n<p>I played the same list in President of servers. Counting that, it went 5-2-1, the timed draw being against Gang Sign Leela. It only faced Liza twice, going 1-1 against the eventual winner. I think a similar build in Palana is also fine at the moment (dropping Quest to use 3 Border Control, as scoring opportunities are harder to come by) and that it should also play the 2 Crisium.

As suggested as a possibility, we decided to cut <a href=\"/en/card/04079\">Punitive</a>s for <a href=\"/en/card/11060\">Scarcity</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning behind the change was our meta-guess: Punitive is a dead draw against <a href=\"/en/card/22008\">Liza</a> and many runners would likely have many resources to once more make Scarcity a poison it has always been. Even though a kill threat makes runners play more carefully, Scarcity might stop that kill-steal from happening in the first place by slowing down the runner.</p>\n\n<p>If you have no kill plan, <a href=\"/en/card/10094\">Consulting Visit</a> has less use and was switched into <a href=\"/en/card/07027\">Cyberdex Virus Suite</a>, which main purpose was to make life little more difficult for <a href=\"/en/card/21081\">Khumalo</a>, if you can create uncomfortable faceplant with <a href=\"/en/card/11112\">Chiyashi</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/07015\">Orion</a>. It also has an added benefit of helping score a win with <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile Takeover</a> against <a href=\"/en/card/08001\">Clot</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The deck felt solid and even with only scoring plan, totally viable to play. Lost one game to flood and two to piloting mistakes. First was not playing <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a> on RnD against Liza and losing to <a href=\"/en/card/12023\">Counter Surveillance</a>, second was in the grand finals when I missed the <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a> in heap and totally botched my scoring attempt. Artturi played really well so that game I might have lost anyways, but it was certainly a turning point after which I did not have viable outs anymore.</p>\n\n<p>So the deck/variance dropped only 1 game whole day and otherwise had wins or a good fighting chance, if not for the pilot, so I consider it a solid list.

The name is both a reference to the refinement process that is time spent playtesting and a play on words on our Downfall and soon-to-be-released Uprising meta.</p>\n\n<p>The game plan is to play passively early, allowing your drip cards to slowly build an economic advantage. 3x Rezeki, 1x Beth and 1x Symmetrical Visage are your early drip investments. Just one of these cards installed on turn one can net you around 15 credits over the course of the game. Installing two of them early is devastating. Don't feel bad about clicking for draw or credits; keep your focus on getting your drip cards installed and your credits up. And don't be tempted to run early against kill decks as taking a Hard Hitting News too soon will ruin your long-term goal.</p>\n\n<p>When time time is right, usually after the tempo hit of scoring out a 3-pointer, hit HARD with a Diversion of Funds or two to send the corp straight to 419 credit hell. After multiple turns of dripping 3-4 credits into your account while dripping 1-2 credits away from the corp with 419 and Grant you will be at a massive economic advantage. Now that your investment has paid off, play aggressively, dripping even more with Paragon, Amina, PAD Taps and Daily Casts while you load your Turning Wheel for the win.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some notes about the card choices</p>\n\n<p>Swift is out. The old Shizuku deck had more early pressure in the form of 3x Inside Job, but as stated the deck is better when played passively early. With only six run events in this list Swift makes no sense. Paragon is a generally better console because it doesn't need any support cards, you only need to run which will happens plenty in the mid and late game.</p>\n\n<p>Maemi is out. If you count the credits on events from the old Shizuku deck, not including Sure Gamble, we get 29. Here, that number is 20, which is not enough fuel for the mystical companion. Replacing her is 1x Beth and 1x Symmetrical Visage. Beth may seem like an odd choice given the credit denial plan but any corp worth it's salt can stay above five credits against 419. And if they can't, don't worry about Beth not dripping because you're winning the game.</p>\n\n<p>Symmetrical Visage may seem like another odd choice because I haven't seen it played in some time but it works like a charm for our game plan. We are going to click for a card most turns anyway and combo'ed with The Class Act our click is now doing serious work.</p>\n\n<p>Same Old Thing is out. With Maemi gone we are no longer under pressure to clear her with SoT on Sure Gamble. I have also cut power events like Embezzle and Legwork. In this build SoT is not worth the slot.</p>\n\n<p>For our silver bullets, No One Home is replaced by Citadel Sanctuary, Hunting Grounds and Caldera. While installing No One Home for a zero cost Grant trigger is great, HHN protection not needed with our strategy of playing a passive early game. Using Citadel Sanctuary and Hunting Grounds to clear single tags is more effective against decks like Argus and CtM because getting out-tempo'ed is more of a threat than getting killed.</p>\n\n<p>The one flexible slot is the Stimhack. With this deck's econ I don't think it is necessary. The 45th card could be better slotted as a second Special Order because when you reach the turn when you're econ allows you to play aggressively you will need your breakers installed. Or, because Stimhack is best against glacier, you could try Hernando Cortez or Baklan Bochkin.</p>\n\n<p>With this deck's economy, credit denial, silver bullets and one of the best breaker suites in the game you will find that you have very few weak match-ups. No Inside Job means getting rushed is a problem, but if you can survive the early game while you build your drips you will be on your way to an overwhelmingly strong mid and late game.</p>\n\n<p>Kampai!</p>\n", "user_id": 31240, "user_name": "ClosDeLaRoche", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11008": 3, "11030": 1, "11070": 1, "12104": 3, "12105": 1, "21044": 3, "21063": 1, "21064": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25030": 1, "25032": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 2, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "26026": 3, "03053": 3, "08009": 1, "09035": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57664": {"id": 57664, "date_creation": "2019-11-10T22:10:09+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-10T22:10:09+00:00", "name": "Exile: Trying to make him work", "description": "<p>The deck is just a toolbox of stuff to deal with everything.

Turns out people weren't ready for it, as it dropped only 3 games between us for the whole tournament, including the cut.</p>\n\n<p>It's a natural evolution of Spags' CTM kill list from Magnum Opus, but with a few key changes and accommodations to account for the current meta.</p>\n\n<hr /><p><em>Hit Lady Lib, trash your ProCo</em></p>\n\n<p><em>'Cause your tempo lookin' slow slow</em></p>\n\n<p><em>If you runnin', I go loco</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Hit you with that treinta ocho</em></p>\n\n<hr /><p>The goal of the deck is to really fork the runner so that they have no good options. Eventually, they're going to take a tag whether they want to or not, and that's when the fun begins. Once the runner commits to holding tags, you'll most often end the game with BOOM!, but you can also use Psychographics recursion to end the game.</p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of the Psychographics is a key difference from the Magnum Opus list. This is to account for the high amount of Liza we expected to face. All of these newfangled Liza lists are packing Paparazzi and Dummy Box, a combo that pretty much locks you out of the kill plan. We toyed with a few tech cards to account for this: The All-Seeing I, Self Growth Program, Information Overload, but settled on Psychographics as it was the most impactful card of the bunch while also being tutorable through Consulting Visit.</p>\n\n<p>If the runner chooses not to run, you also have the ability to swerve out with Lady Liberty. Rezzing Lady Lib and immediately adding ARES to your score area is maybe the sweetest thing in Netrunner, and if you've never experienced it, I highly recommend it.</p>\n\n<p>Hydra also came in as our Tollbooth replacement. While Tollbooth is a fine ice in its own right, we preferred the heavier facecheck penalty that Hydra offered, even to a runner that isn't holding tags yet.

I found myself in the hole early and though the wins in the final Swiss rounds brought me level to 2nd place on points, my earlier Runner errors resulted in the worst strength of schedule among the 27-pointers. The deck finished 6-0 with matchups comprised of two Valencia Estevez, a MaxX, a Leela Patel, a Smoke, and an Adam.</p>\n\n<p>I started from Hoclor\u2019s list found here: https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57257/same-old-argus-8th-at-worlds. After testing out some cards and returning nearly full circle, I arrived at the iteration before you. The Prisecs were underwhelming and the Excalibur failed to make any kind of impact during testing. Additionally, my team and Whiteblade advanced development of Liza lists to the extent that I believed any attempt to actually win the tournament would necessitate winning the Liza matchup.</p>\n\n<p>During testing I found a more stock Argus had a nigh unwinnable matchup against Liza were she to employ a general strategy of taking a mulligan for The Class Act, playing with patience, and drawing the lockout pieces with relative consistency. As such, tech was needed in order to swing the matchup back to Argus. To this end, I cut the already underwhelming Prisec, shaved the number of Data Ravens due to their ineffectiveness as slowing Liza, and leaned into Consulting Visit. After testing Corporate Town to some extent but finding it too vulnerable to Political Operative and remote lock, I settled on Self-Growth Program (SGP) based on my past experiences with the card concerning its effectiveness at combating specifically Paparazzi. On the day I failed to face any Liza, but in testing the SGP dramatically swung back the Liza matchup to favor Argus.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone who was kind enough to share in some games of Original Netrunner, and a special thanks to all of my friends who made the weekend such an incredible experience.</p>\n", "user_id": 8567, "user_name": "webster", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 3, "11016": 2, "11080": 1, "11094": 1, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21016": 1, "21036": 3, "21039": 2, "21080": 3, "21119": 3, "22056": 2, "25112": 2, "25124": 3, "25125": 1, "25126": 3, "25130": 1, "25133": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 1, "26058": 2, "28005": 3, "07001": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57625": {"id": 57625, "date_creation": "2019-11-06T03:40:57+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-08T05:52:12+00:00", "name": "Cards in hand? (6th @ US Nationals)", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/RealVenomousLegBlargNaut\">\"Cards in hand?\" ... \"Two. Am I dead?\" ... \"Yep.\"</a></p>\n\n<p>I tested many variations on Palana for US Nationals, starting with the Worlds second place deck. I leaned heavily on Scarcity, which astute readers will already have noticed is absent from this list. After reflecting on conversations with <code>@bblum</code> and <code>@jdeng</code> at and after Worlds, and testing with numerous folks in the test group I joined, I concluded that a cheaper ice suite and a bit of disincentive to hammer centrals was worth the sacrifice of potential tempo from a turn one Scarcity. </p>\n\n<p>That choice was one hundred percent correct. If I were competing again tomorrow, it would be tough to convince me to change anything about this list. A DRM would be wonderful, but that's a meta call for a world where you don't need two Crisiums and two IP Blocks to handle Aumakua decks generally, and Liza decks specifically. You could maybe swap Archived for Preemptive, slot a DRM, and trade Macrophage for the third IP Block. That's about the extent to which I would consider changing anything. Aiki is bananapants, don't cut it. </p>\n\n<p>I also had a bye, which gave me the luxury of a bye-sweep-sweep-split-ID-ID day 1, sending me into the cut in 5th on breakers. </p>\n\n<p>The end of the first game is linked above. I rushed to 5 points, got my Nisei turntabled after playing the odds on R&amp;D, then once I noticed <code>@cranked</code> playing around the Palana ID to deny me credits, I Archived a La Costa and put it in my remote with another card. </p>\n\n<p>The second game was an Anansi flatline after rushing to 5 points forced a desperation Khusyuk with one fewer credit than necessary to break. </p>\n\n<p>The third game vs <code>@greyfield</code> was closer, with Wanton and Doof slowing me down considerably, but once I saw there was no AI solution in the deck, I waited for Levy and IAA'd the winning Obokata from 5 credits, a Nisei token, and a rezzed Excalibur. </p>\n\n<p>In the cut, I ran twice, going 1-1 and putting me into an elimination game vs Robby on stealth Wu. I'm going to go deep on this game, so people who aren't interested, stop reading now! :)</p>\n\n<p>I looked at his deck list and noticed BlacKat, which is pretty effective against my barrier-heavy ice suite. We took turns going in the tank in this game, and I honestly think that if the game had been untimed, it would have been the best game of the entire tournament for me. Unfortunately, we got a 5 minute warning when I was up 5-0 with a Nisei token and 2 Border Controls on my remote. I tried to speed up my play in order to avoid seeming like I was intentionally slow rolling to win on time, and that ended up costing me heavily. A stretch of dud draws gave me relatively few good options, and Robby got to 5 as time was called, giving him the timed win as the higher seed and knocking me out of the tournament. </p>\n\n<p>I spent a while reflecting on what I could have done differently, given the cards as they came up, and two days later I think I figured out the right line. When we got the 5-minute warning, I had two Kakugos and Aiki on R&amp;D, nothing on HQ, and two Border Controls and Thimblerig on my remote, with an unadvanced Bio Vault installed in it. I had two useless Crisium Grids in hand. Robby's rig was BlacKat, Refractor, Cloak, and a Clone Chip with access to Pelangi and SMC. Low real credits, but plenty of stealth, a freshly installed Turning Wheel, and a Film Critic.</p>\n\n<p>Without time as a consideration, the plan had been to draw for an ice that would tax (Anansi, Excalibur, the third Border Control), install it on HQ, then swap it to the remote to score and win. </p>\n\n<p>What actually happened: I drew a Nisei on the first click after time was called. I immediately IA'd it, then trashed everything defending it, even though I knew Robby would be able to get it. I was hoping he would use up enough resources that I would be able to defend R&amp;D and HQ, or maybe score something else if I drew a better ice. But I hadn't taken the time to do the math on the stealth credits, and it cost him relatively little while costing me all of my future flexibility. Over the next couple of turns,  I drew into Obokata, a useless Celebrity Gift, and Anansi, so I just IA'd the Obokata and extended the hand when he ran it and broke Anansi.</p>\n\n<p>What I should have done: NA the Nisei to bluff it as a Snare, and give it up without using my token or Border Controls if he ran it. Swap Thimblerig to R&amp;D for a couple of turns just to threaten swapping Border Control over to deny deep Turning Wheel digs. Then I could have stuck to my original plan of installing the next useful ice I drew (Anansi in this case) on HQ to swap out later. Swap Thimblerig to the remote -- which might have triggered an HQ run / dig, but I had the credits to rez Anansi to make it expensive -- and AA the Bio Vault if I still had it. After that, if I still had the Obo and the Vault, I would win. If not, well, at least this line was better odds than what I did!</p>\n\n<p>Big points to Robby for being a gracious, thoughtful, and very challenging opponent. I'd love to play again in the future, and hopefully get some revenge for being knocked out. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Anti for testing extensively with me and beating this deck over and over as I refined it, and for giving me pep talks and matchup advice whenever I needed it. You know who you are. &lt;3 </p>\n\n<p>I stuck with it in part because of its power against non-Liza runners and in part because I was tired of playing Outfit and didn't trust the Liza matchup even with tech. Palana has tons of high-level lines to find, between Runner turn Thimblerig swaps and NA / IA / IAA choices. If you can put two cards facedown in your remote, you can bluff almost anything as almost anything else. </p>\n\n<p>I had a ton of fun at US Nationals. I'll be back.</p>\n", "user_id": 225, "user_name": "Ajar", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10030": 1, "11032": 2, "11094": 2, "11119": 1, "12013": 3, "12070": 3, "21038": 1, "21039": 3, "21051": 3, "21072": 2, "21080": 3, "22039": 2, "23054": 3, "25079": 1, "25087": 3, "25091": 2, "25100": 1, "25139": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26112": 3, "28006": 1, "06111": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57626": {"id": 57626, "date_creation": "2019-11-06T03:40:58+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-06T03:48:11+00:00", "name": "\"DLR\"", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 225, "user_name": "Ajar", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10043": 1, "11041": 2, "12104": 3, "12108": 3, "21044": 3, "21064": 3, "21065": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "22008": 1, "22012": 1, "25024": 1, "25026": 1, "25027": 1, "25030": 1, "25039": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 1, "26016": 1, "26017": 1, "26018": 3, "03054": 1, "08087": 3, "08108": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57627": {"id": 57627, "date_creation": "2019-11-06T03:47:18+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-07T07:18:35+00:00", "name": "Ravens are Rude (9-2 @ CoL & Worlds '19)", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 225, "user_name": "Ajar", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10017": 3, "10094": 2, "11016": 2, "11078": 2, "11080": 1, "11097": 3, "21078": 3, "21080": 3, "21119": 1, "22050": 1, "22056": 3, "25079": 1, "25111": 2, "25112": 3, "25124": 2, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "26056": 3, "26060": 2, "27006": 1, "28005": 3, "06111": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57628": {"id": 57628, "date_creation": "2019-11-06T03:47:18+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-06T08:04:39+00:00", "name": "Rude MaxX", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 225, "user_name": "Ajar", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11042": 2, "11061": 2, "11081": 2, "21103": 3, "21105": 1, "25005": 1, "25007": 3, "25010": 3, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 2, "26072": 3, "03035": 2, "03038": 2, "03054": 3, "06033": 1, "06073": 3, "07029": 1, "07035": 2, "08043": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57629": {"id": 57629, "date_creation": "2019-11-06T09:46:16+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-07T17:18:44+00:00", "name": "La Cosa Nostra (5-1, 10th @ US Nationals)", "description": "<p>This deck performed well for me at US Nationals this year. I have been playing it for the last 2-3 months. Basically it's a fast Palana deck. When <a href=\"/en/card/26112\">La Costa Grid</a> came out, my first thought was that never-advancing <a href=\"/en/card/01068\">Nisei MK II</a> would be amazing -- after trying that out for a bit, I found that it was a bit niche and that <a href=\"/en/card/26112\">La Costa</a> is less of a <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan</a> and more of a sick drip econ card. <a href=\"/en/card/26112\">La Costa</a> building up <a href=\"/en/card/21072\">Bio Vault</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/21039\">NGO</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/02033\">Trick of Light</a> counters accelerates you a lot and is an annoying card for runners to trash. It enables a lot of bluffing opportunities as well. Single-advancing <a href=\"/en/card/12070\">Obokata</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/21038\">SSL</a> is nice. Scoring a 3/2 and jamming another is also great. If you squint very hard, an over-advanced <a href=\"/en/card/26040\">Project Yagi-Uda</a> is kind of like a crappy Nisei counter for your remote.</p>\n\n<p>The deck is able to go fast with cheap ice and gear checks of each type. (<a href=\"/en/card/08014\">Cortex Lock</a> is a pseudo-gear check especially when trying to score <a href=\"/en/card/12070\">Obokata</a>) In addition <a href=\"/en/card/11060\">Scarcity of Resources</a> is ridiculous when there are only 5 non-<a href=\"/en/card/12070\">Obokata</a> agendas in the deck.</p>\n\n<p>It is not hard to get to 5 points with this deck, and from there you have multiple ways to close the game even if the runner gets set up. Half of the agendas are fast advance-able. You also have 3x <a href=\"/en/card/23054\">Border</a> 3x <a href=\"/en/card/21072\">Bio Vault</a> that can help you score the last agenda -- in addition these help protect you against Diversion of Funds and Apocalypse.</p>\n\n<p>I had a lot of fun at this event.

First round Argus beat Liza. It was my first time seeing that deck, I had an hpt in my opening hand so I felt pretty good until paparazzis and a wireless net pavilion hit the table.  I didn't have much of a boardstate so I figured a flatline was my out regardless so I moneyed up and trashed them for 8 credits before my opponent could draw a dummy box. He played really well and got to 5 points and had some well timed Diversion of Funds.</p>\n\n<p>Second round was against Freedom.  I goofed pretty badly because I forgot about a tag my opponent couldn't clear. Otherwise I could've gotten the kill with broad daylight and hpt.  They stole a GFI and cleared two tags on their next turn and I used broad daylight and punitive counterstrike to get the kill.</p>\n\n<p>My MaxX games were fun and I chose the deck because it was consistently okay against a wide range of decks. I wish I'd chosen something more interesting like my Apex or Reina deck.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the tournament looked like:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Lunch - Panic Attack</p></li>\n<li><p>Round 3 - Autistic Shutdown; Panic Attack 2 Electric Boogaloo</p></li>\n<li><p>Round 4 - Migraine, chronic pain flare up</p></li>\n<li><p>Official Withdrawal</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lots of crying.</strong>  Like a lot a lot.</p></li>\n</ul><p>After that I went back to my b&amp;b with my lovely support person and <strong>we confessed our gay love for each other</strong>. Then we soothed each other's chronic pain with cuddles and slept for 14hrs.  All things considered it was a great day.</p>\n\n<p>I was one of the recipients of the travel award for the tournament.  I came to San Francisco all the way from Orlando with high hopes.  I expected to finish all my rounds and place above average, but below the cut, just like every other tournament ever, but my health is super unpredictable.  </p>\n\n<p>Shoutout to my support person, Ash, who came from Atlanta to help me with accessibility stuff.  They have more experience traveling while disabled than I do and honestly I doubt I could've made it to the tournament at all without their help.</p>\n\n<h1>The Deck</h1>\n\n<p>I made funky decisions cuz I play an awful lot of Argus and it's sorta boring and vanilla if you play what's optimal.

The loss was to Jaiden's Apoc Omar which I played poorly against. I began setting up my scoring remote prematurely hoping to get a few agendas out of a moderately flooded HQ, foolishly placing a Border Control on the remote rather than a central. To beat Apoc you need to stop DDoS with a Building Blocked Chiyashi or Orion on R&amp;D or Archives, OAI an Afshar as the outer layer on HQ, and get a Crisium Grid or Border Control on a central. This seems like a lot but it's more manageable than it sounds. Unfortunately I played a middling runner game, going 2-4 with my Apoc Val to finish the day in 18th place.</p>\n\n<p>I've been on Blue Sun since March of this year and it has served me very, very well. It's worst showing was at GenCon in the Laamb Surfer Wu meta, but even then it went 4-2. At all other tournaments it's gone either undefeated or lost a single game, for a cumulative record of 25-5.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some piloting tips and notes on my card choices:</p>\n\n<p>1) I didn't get one Punitive kill all day; consider it your back-up plan. There are too many defenses against Punitive to lean heavily on it, so always focus on scoring and don't play sloppy to try to get a kill. I've gone \"vegan\" by swapping Punitive with Scarcity with good results and do recommend this depending on your play style and/or meta.</p>\n\n<p>2) Don't play more than three ice that do not have an ETR subroutine, and two is ideal. The ice you choose for these slots should be heavily taxing, not too expensive to rez, placed on R&amp;D or Archives, and fairly immune to Hippo. Slot Machine is the best choice. I tested Excalibur with mixed results; sometimes it wins you games when combo'ed with Border Control, but too often the runner doesn't care about its subroutine. It's also best on the scoring remote and we have enough great \"scoring remote\" ice here without Excalibur.</p>\n\n<p>3) Without Preemptive you need cheap \"rush\" ice to compliment Border Control in case you get flooded. Afshar is excellent. Running three copies feels fine because you are Blue Sun and replacing it on HQ later is not a problem. Gatekeeper is also a fine choice which doubles as punishing facecheck ice.</p>\n\n<p>4) That said, at least two \"punishing facecheck\" ice are needed. Fairchild 3.0 is the perfect choice. It can tax, deal Brain Damage, ETR, go on any server in any position, it's good early, mid and late game, and its annoyingly expensive to break with all but Amina or a loaded turtle. The one thing it can't do is act as an early rush ice, but Gatekeeper can! I consider Gatekeeper not only \"rush\" ice but also \"punishing\" ice because allowing its first subroutine to fire solves two major problems: bad draw and agenda flooding.</p>\n\n<p>5) Two copies of Crisium Grid is a necessity in the 3.4 meta. If I were to possibly recommend a change to this list it would be to swap a Consulting Visit for a third Crisium. Can we take a moment to consider what it hampers if not neuters? Apocalypse, Diversion of Funds, Embezzle, Khyusuk, Stargate, Legwork, Dirty Laundry, Omar, Alice, Liza, Knobkierie, Paragon, Wanton Destruction... need I go on?</p>\n\n<p>6) The \"Blue Sun Ice/Operation Econ Package\" feels right at 3x Chiyashi, 2x Orion, 3x Building Blocks, 3x Oversight AI. Orion is the weakest card here, and 3 copies feels like overkill to me. Please, when playing Blue Sun always keep in mind that Orion is unique! If not for that diamond I'd recommend 3 copies, but as it is, too often that third copy ends up as Surveyor fuel at best. I often see OAI at two or even one copy in Blue Sun decks but I do not recommend it. Blue Sun is at its strongest when you can get this combo going on turn one and three copies of OAI ensure that this happens as consistently as possible.</p>\n\n<p>In 3.3 Surfer Wu simply demolished Blue Sun but with Laamb banned the deck has serious legs. Its few weaknesses include D4, Hippo and bad draw. It's a very fun, very strong deck that's not terribly difficult to pilot &amp; I couldn't recommend it enough for your next tournament!</p>\n\n<p>Cheers and Always Be Printing Credits!</p>\n", "user_id": 31240, "user_name": "ClosDeLaRoche", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11049": 1, "11112": 3, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "22029": 1, "22055": 3, "25079": 1, "25123": 1, "25124": 2, "25137": 3, "25138": 3, "25139": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 1, "26056": 3, "26058": 3, "28004": 2, "28005": 3, "07015": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57612": {"id": 57612, "date_creation": "2019-11-05T08:16:19+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T08:16:19+00:00", "name": "Run it back!", "description": "<p>This is my modestly updated version of the Sportsmetal combo deck.

I designed it to counter the Freedom and Apoc Anarch JNet meta I was seeing leading up to Nats. It turned out to be a good call because I played 3 Freedoms, Apoc Val and a good stuff 419 and yote 'em all. </p>\n\n<p>The idea is simple: Make money, rez thicc bois, and yeet the runner when they try to contest anything. There are so many outs with this deck and generally has favorable matchups. Getting the two card combo of Building Blocks + Chiyashyeet is likely an auto-win as it's very difficult for current runners to deal with a Chiyashyeet every time they run. You don't need it, but if you do land the combo, throw it on any central. Archives might be correct if you expect a lot of R&amp;D pressure like Stargate. Once Chiyashiyeet is on the outside, just easily score out as they dig for answers. </p>\n\n<p>Go fast and loose! Push that SSL even if you might not score it. You'll tax the runner through some annoying ice and make them commit programs. Then you can hit the gas on a real scoring plan while getting the SSL drip and furthering your board state. Don't jam Batty unless you have a trash program sub or are pushing an agenda. </p>\n\n<p>Against Freedom don't be afraid to loose a Building Blocked Chiyashyeet to D4 &amp; Hippo. That's why you have two preemptives and don't use them too early! Thimblerig is MVP in all matchups but especially true VS anarch. Get it rezzed so you can move ice around for more and yeet yeet repeat. </p>\n\n<p>The Apoc matchup is typically slower as you need to spend the effort making sure you don't loose your board state, but it a favorable matchup as your ID is basically Border Control on a stick.

The deck did so well at the side event that i brought it to the main event. It has a solid gameplan that works against any runner backed by good money and ice.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplan: set up a server to make them lose all their clicks via mason bellamy/elp/taxing ice, then bounce them with ash/border control/ikawah. Biotic is there as a finisher should you need it.</p>\n\n<p>Money: Bbg over jinja as it saves slightly more money and combos very well with adonis at the cost of clicks, keeping your ice hidden is also a huge boon. Rashida over vlc to bait runs/sneak out vitruvius, rest is just the most click efficient money i could cram in there.</p>\n\n<p>Ice: fc3 and border control are the crux of the deck, fc3 is devastating against anarch rigs and bc makes mason bellamy servers airtight. Thimblerig and architect allow you to play around hippo while being strong ice on their own. Ip block and surveyor are vanity influence, and aren't essential if you'd like to run something else (calibration testing comes to mind).</p>\n\n<p>Agendas: Ikawah is a combo piece, vitruvius allows for never advance, timely gives you another border control and ssl should probably be a gfi but it's fun to score and can allow you to run away with a game on tempo.</p>\n\n<p>The rest: elp and the other upgrades all create scoring windows. Preemptive is in case of emergency. Not a lot of fluff in the list as it's all streamlined to score out.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I'm very happy with the list. Elp seems very strong at the moment and while it went 7-3 across 2 events i can count more play mistakes on my part than changes I'd make to the list. A simple list with multiple lines of play tends to do well in a field with so many different runner options so i can highly recommend this between now and rotation.</p>\n\n<p>Shoutout to pj20 as this is based on his nats list from last year.</p>\n", "user_id": 836, "user_name": "itsbigfoot", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11049": 3, "11080": 1, "11094": 2, "21009": 1, "21010": 3, "21038": 1, "21080": 2, "21118": 1, "22039": 2, "25068": 3, "25070": 3, "25077": 1, "25079": 1, "25080": 1, "25082": 2, "25083": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "28005": 3, "28006": 1, "06022": 3, "06061": 3, "06111": 1, "07027": 1, "08040": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57622": {"id": 57622, "date_creation": "2019-11-05T20:01:09+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T20:01:09+00:00", "name": "Peakahyoubu", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 9786, "user_name": "phette23", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10071": 1, "11053": 2, "12013": 3, "12054": 1, "12070": 3, "12095": 3, "21014": 1, "21038": 1, "21039": 3, "21051": 2, "21096": 2, "23045": 3, "25086": 3, "25087": 1, "25091": 3, "25100": 3, "25138": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26039": 1, "26045": 2, "05018": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57623": {"id": 57623, "date_creation": "2019-11-05T23:03:59+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-13T07:42:36+00:00", "name": "Running It Back 1812 (1st US Nationals 2019)", "description": "<p>Heading into US Nationals, I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I had prepared a lot more for worlds and had only broken even. Being down on myself, I felt kinda washed up. I was excited to visit friends in San Francisco, but I didn\u2019t test a ton. Argus on corp side seemed generically strong, but instead of bringing an apoc val like I thought was good, I decided to tune up a liza list I had played in side events at worlds. Patrick Burke had suggested a revolutionary change: dropping the breaker suite for 3 aumakua, 3 femme fatale. All in on the Counter Surveillance plan, I tested further, eventually I cut my film critics for more draw in the form of street peddlers, smoothed out the consistency by going to more copies of class act, and went to 3x hot pursuit. I was skeptical at first, but the raw burst econ was too valuable to leave out. </p>\n\n<p>The broad gameplan of the deck is to gather money via rogue trading/paragon/hot pursuit and convert that into a double digits counter surveillance on RnD. You have the dummy box/paparazzi combo to grind out kill decks and avoid meat damage.</p>\n\n<p>Day 1:\nI showed up with Joseki to the event on Saturday, hung out with my friends, and got ready to play the tournament..</p>\n\n<p>Round 1: Bye, 2-0</p>\n\n<p>Round 2: Joe Schupp (Liza-Argus) 3-1</p>\n\n<p>I was terrified to play Joe. Not only did I know he was excellent, we were on same decks. His liza was on obelus stargate, mine counter surveillance. Before the tournament began he confided in me at asked \u201cdoes your deck have the liza tech\u201d. He then explained to me that all of the Anti testing house was on some amount of anti liza tech in the form of self growth program, to bounce paparazzi back to hand and then high profile target. I got an early paparazzi dummy box set up and rushed to 3, but then Joe consulted for Self Growth Program and HPT\u2019d me. I won my Argus game.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3: Alexis Spicer (Hayley-Argus) 5-1</p>\n\n<p>Alexis was very pleasant to play against. I hung back for a few turns as I struggled to draw into my combo, but a street peddler into a street peddler set me up. After that I could run hq through a maus to be able to land doof and hot pursuit. I converted into a counter surveillance and won. I think she did not have enough etr ice/border controls to lock me out of the remote.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4: Californian (419-PE) 7-1</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sorry for forgetting your name, but I played a very kind Californian in the 4th round. I got lucky and stole an early Obokata on HQ off of a hot pursuit run. I cooled down for a while and made money to set up for Counter Surveillance. I installed a class act, and next turn with a class act trigger, drug dealer trigger, 2 clicks to draw and a liza trigger Counter Surveillance\u2019d him for 12 cards, and won. </p>\n\n<p>Round 5: ID</p>\n\n<p>Round 6: ID</p>\n\n<p>Day 2:\nI played a sick game of Arkham horror with my friends, then got ready for the cut. All the remaining Liza games I played were played on stream, so I\u2019m not going to detail them. Tldr is I went undefeated with Liza in the cut, and eventually came up from losers to win US Nats.</p>\n\n<p>Specific card choices:</p>\n\n<p>The most cuttable cards in this list are Drug Dealer and Baklan. I think as more people play hard ETR effects to counter this list, you probably want a second lucky charm. I wouldn\u2019t change the breaker suite, and it\u2019s quite possibly correct to cut the special order. With this deck now being a known quantity, I would make space for 2x or 3x corporate grant for all the scarcity people are going to play. Polop should not be cut. </p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I want to shout out all the people who supported me or hung out with me, in no specific order:</p>\n\n<p>Spags, Cranked, Cavis, Jesse, Joe, Jason, Austin, Wes, Joseki, Issac, Eric, CTZ, Brian, Stephen, Timmy, Dien, Samrs, Ran, Rotage, Alexis, Jakuza, Justin, Bruno, Melissia, Gerry and the Kitchen Table Podcast.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I want to offer a deeper thank you to Ajar, Cat and Pat. These people provided a pillar of not only emotional, but also financial support. You all made the weekend very special, and I\u2019m deeply humbled to be your friend.</p>\n", "user_id": 11664, "user_name": "Whiteblade111", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"12023": 2, "12104": 3, "12108": 3, "21065": 3, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "22008": 1, "22009": 3, "25027": 2, "25030": 1, "25032": 3, "25036": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26014": 1, "26017": 1, "26018": 3, "08062": 3, "08083": 1, "08087": 3, "08108": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57591": {"id": 57591, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T03:02:04+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-10T19:45:19+00:00", "name": "Rakes - 5th* and 8th at US Nationals", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 8046, "user_name": "greyfield", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11032": 3, "11050": 2, "11051": 1, "11080": 3, "12013": 3, "12070": 3, "12072": 2, "12113": 3, "21014": 1, "21073": 3, "21096": 2, "25080": 2, "25084": 1, "25088": 1, "25091": 3, "25103": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26041": 3, "05004": 3, "05007": 1, "05017": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57592": {"id": 57592, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T03:02:05+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-15T11:05:51+00:00", "name": "Ilinx", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 8046, "user_name": "greyfield", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11042": 2, "11081": 2, "21103": 3, "21105": 1, "25005": 1, "25007": 1, "25010": 3, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 2, "27001": 2, "27002": 2, "03035": 2, "03053": 3, "03054": 3, "06073": 3, "07029": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 3, "07038": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57594": {"id": 57594, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T07:33:24+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T18:51:24+00:00", "name": "Self-growth argus", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 220, "user_name": "tmoiynmwg", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10094": 2, "11016": 2, "11040": 2, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21016": 1, "21036": 2, "21039": 2, "21080": 3, "21119": 3, "22056": 1, "23054": 3, "25112": 3, "25124": 3, "25125": 1, "25126": 3, "25130": 1, "25133": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26056": 1, "26058": 3, "07001": 1, "09026": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57595": {"id": 57595, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T09:18:22+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-10T23:07:34+00:00", "name": "bin.dec 2019", "description": "<p>Bin and in.</p>\n\n<p>The rules:<br />\n- All 0-influence cards with trash effects must go in, full playsets (3-of or 6-of as appropriate)<br />\n- Influence may only be spent on cards with trash effects<br />\n- You're allowed 3 Tech Trader and 3 Hostage<br />\n- As a concession, I also took 1 Bukhgalter since there are no \"permanent\" killers  following the rotation of Lustig  </p>\n\n<p>Some observations:<br />\nPeddler is still the most fun card in Netrunner and an automatic splash here<br />\nGbahali is really quite a lot better than Kongamato.<br />\nBochkin combos with tag-removal of Forger or Kill Switch very nicely for some bonus  draw and money.<br />\n3 Same Old Thing is mandatory so just use it for Hostage -&gt; Tech Trader.

Against rush, this lets us always maintain the threat of Leela bounce on an advanced card, and against assets, this gives us a steady source of econ as well as letting us only make impactful R+D runs. Sadly, until you assemble the full kit, you're mostly playing as a slower/worse 419, and while the FTT+Leela threat is powerful, it never ended up being as gamebreaking as I wanted it to be, especially at the cost of all of your Criminal power moves being telegraphed.</p>\n\n<p>Props:</p>\n\n<p>Grant + 0 costers</p>\n\n<p>2x regass breaker suite</p>\n\n<p>Slops:</p>\n\n<p>Despite the combo, RNG Key felt very medium.

I was pretty set on playing either Freedom or Hayley for U.S. Nationals 2019, as I was not really feeling any attachment to a specific Runner.  However, in my near daily JNET quests, I played a game against a user named \u2018Gorlomi\u2019 (apologize for the spelling), I believe.  They were on a Liza deck that thoroughly stomped my CTM kill deck, which will always get my attention.  I saw how quickly they were able to lock me out of killing them, and how they could then control the board state at will.  The idea of this deck excited me, unnaturally, and I was compelled to build it.</p>\n\n<p>So, a little more than a week before US Nats, I put together a build of what I thought would work and tried it out.  Surprisingly, it performed better than expected.  Klokotze saw what I was doing (under of smurf, of course), and we collaborated a bit on it.  I also brought to the attention of my anti teammates, and discussed it with Whiteblade, as well, as he tried Liza at Crown of Lazers.  The anti kids started to put the deck through the testing gauntlet, trying various cards and builds, while facing a variety of matchups, both good and bad.  To my surprise, what I was going to bring to have some fun with was being repped by most of my team.  We have had our own various pieces of tech to play around with, but played very similar lists.</p>\n\n<p>A few things drew me to playing the deck.  First, it felt a bit like old DLR decks.  This shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as Liza fits that mold well, and Liza DLR is a fun Eternal deck.  The usage of Paparazzi and protecting that while keeping the econ low were DLR staples.  This doesn\u2019t have the easy button of DLR, but Stargate can create a nice lock, while helping control damage vs. Jinteki dex.  Dummy Box is straight dumb, and can both keep you and your resources alive, while also saving your programs if need be.  Second, this deck gave me an old skool Criminal feel I haven\u2019t experienced in a minute.  One wants to be very aggressive early, facechecking at will just to force costly ICE rezzing.  The deck is a control deck, and the primary aspect of that control is econ denial.  The combination of Grant, DoF, Amina, and de-rez, along with running every central will generally keep the Corp low on credits.  Smash all money sources you can, usually leaving the weakest alive to feed the PAD Taps.  Third, I liked the unfamiliarity people would have with this build.  Some would attempt to attack your resources, perhaps not realizing how many are in the deck, and how they are falling right into the trap of the deck\u2019s primary strat.  Eventually, they would give up.  Kill dex usually have a good out, early, but some times didn\u2019t realize that not only was the window for killing (and usually victory) already shut, but that the drapes were silently closing, also.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a few deck choices and discuss them, quickly:</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Obelus</strong><br />\n  Whiteblade and I discussed this choice.  He preferred a more run-based aggro approach of Paragon.  I leaned into Obelus.  Once set up, it allows you to really take advantage of the card draw.  Not having to waste cards is nice, as it gives one plenty of Dummy Box fuel.  Counter Surveilance is more of a \u2018glass cannon\u2019 effect, and a deck built around that needs to not only setup faster, but implement the plan before defenses are set.  This deck is not that; it is using econ denial and Stargate to control the game, and thus, having a slower console makes sense.  Plus, it helps soak incidental damage, mostly from Jinteki decks.</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Stargate</strong><br />\n  In tandem with what was discussed above, Gate felt good.  Destroying ICE/econ/problems in the mid to late game usually sealed in most wins.  The ability to duck traps is quite nice.  The 2 MU can be a problem, but the classic late game for this deck is to drop the turtle for all 3 reg breakers.  By that point, Aumakua becomes redundant, and you have enough money to fuel the normal breakers.</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Tech cards</strong><br />\n  We tried out a variety of different cards that could help us deal with the problems Liza can face.  Hot Pursuit, Emergency Shutdown, Hernando Cortez, Bank Job, Caldera, and more were shuffled in and out of the list.  The last one was the one I really regretted not slotting, as there was a fair amount of PE at the top tables.  Luckily, I only faced one, in the Swiss.  These are the slots where you can modify based on need or meta calls.  Some of our group wanted two PolOps, to deal with Corporate Town/Asa/Jeeves/etc.  I found it\u2019s also really good versus NGO, as I have seen a lot of pre-rezzing due to Falsified.  Combining both into a deck is great, as King Joe was trying that in Val recently, to positive results. </p>\n\n<p>I was on Emergency Shutdown, but eventually went over to Baklan.  It\u2019s a fun card, is another resource for Dummy fuel, and most importantly, doesn\u2019t require an HQ run.  If you have too many HQ reliant cards (DoF, Leg, Embezzle, Hot Pursuit, PolOp, and many more in Crim), a stalwart defense there leads to a lot of dead cards in the Grip.  I decided to cut back on those, going back to only 1 Leg and no Shutdowns.  Baklan takes time to build but can really help when faceplanting.  Also, he creates a quandary for Border Control.  If they don\u2019t pop it before you encounter the ICE, you can then de-rez and walk through (usually in a remote scoring situation) safely.  Fun card, cool art from limnrix.</p>\n\n<p>Citadel and Data Dealer were my other tech cards.  The former was added partially as a joke.  Anti started to tech against ourselves, adding in Self Growth Program into Argus decks.  I decided to join in on the gag, and added a \u2018fourth\u2019 Paparazzi, as they can only bounce two cards to hand.  In truth, it provides more than that.  It can help you control tags, as well.  If facing suspected High Profile Target/Boom decks, keeping tags low early is good.  Also, it helps fight Psychographics.  Data Dealer was added not only to gain econ, but to remove problems.  In the NBN matchup, killing any potential EOI target is key.  Eliminating agendas can also help v. PE, as Philotic and Sting can really create problems.  Finally, eating SSLs add to the austerity.</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Econ</strong><br />\n  PAD Tap and Rogue Trading are very crucial, for the deck is not filled with money.  Protecting those becomes a priority, based on the board state.  Remember, denial is the key, sometimes at the price of also falling into poverty.  The efficiency of the turtle usually really helps to offset this.  Having permaPADs is a real thing, though.</p>\n\n<p>-<strong>Matchups</strong><br />\n  The main predator is a kill deck, usually centered around HPT.  I did get BOOM!'d by allofthemarbles on turn 3 of out SSO, which surprising.  I Gated very early, and saw Punitive and Consulting Visit, which were to be expected, but did not think there'd be the BOOM.  If expecting those, try to not hold more than one tag early.  Clear them, or don't run centrals.  Generally, we mull for Class Act, to get the defense combo set up ASAP.  A Caldera include would have been nice #jonwasright.  Attacking econ is key, and we tried Ms. Bones out to help with that, or just Aeneas, but neither were quick nor impactful enough.  Extreme program trash, such as out of Jemison, can be very nasty, and almost led to me adding Bankrolls to throw to Dummy.  Phat ICE can suck, especially the anti-AI ones (Bulwark, Chiyashi).  Komainu and Psychic Field are REALLY bad.  If you suspect the latter at all, such as in IG, do NOT really run facedowns nor Falsified them.  Embezzle could be an include, especially if you're really worried about Psycho.  Usually, that's a one-of with no CV to find it, though.</p>\n\n<p>My run at Nats was:<br /><em>BYE<br />\nSweep samrs on Liza/Asa<br />\nSwept by allofthemarbles on Wu/SSO<br />\nSweep jakuza on 419/RP<br />\nSweep greyfield on MaxX/PE<br />\nID with stonar<br /><br />\nBeat stonar on Val<br />\nBeat whiteblade111 on Argus<br />\nLost to Spaceice on Gagarin<br />\nLost to whiteblade on Liza<br /></em></p>\n\n<p>This Liza finished 3rd/6th/11th/15th/27th/34th.<br /></p>\n\n<p>Want to close by noting what a fun weekend it was.  There were 6\u201d of snow on the ground when I left Wisconsin, so just facing 70F and sun all weekend was a treat.  I really enjoyed seeing the city of San Francisco, as always, despite my newly torn meniscus.  Mad props to Swan and his crue really killed the tournament.  Not only did they have a full three days of ANR set up, but they also coordinated some sick after-tourney events on both SAT and SUN.  Seriously one of the best overall tourney experiences I\u2019ve had.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a list of people who helped make the weekend better, in some way, in no order (sorry if I missed you):  <br />my lovely wife and daughter, anti kids (webster/cranked/ctz/ajar/dashakan/paranoid/dien/samrs/jdeng/sirris), Kwang, murphy, StephenE, joseki, melissa, tyrell_corp, whiteblade, jakuza, tmoiynmwg, bruno, stonar, ran, bblum, alexis, kysra, icecoldjazz, Robbie, rotage, swan, wes, jay, CryptoGraham, KTM casters</p>\n", "user_id": 2001, "user_name": "spags", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10043": 1, "11041": 2, "11070": 1, "12104": 3, "12108": 3, "21044": 3, "21064": 3, "21065": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "22008": 1, "22012": 1, "25026": 1, "25030": 1, "25039": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 1, "26016": 1, "26017": 2, "26018": 3, "03054": 1, "08087": 3, "08108": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57601": {"id": 57601, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T20:11:18+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-04T20:11:18+00:00", "name": "Minor News Item  3 * Sys Core", "description": "<p>Make sure curious runners hit the \"recently disappeared\" newspapers section.</p>\n\n<p>Deck made out of 3 Nisei System Core 2019.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that Nisei's format System Core 2019 normally uses just 1 core set, meaning that some cards can only be included with 1 or 2 copies in your decks.

I also played Asa Group at last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/51009/jukebox-6-1-us-nats-2nd-place-\">Nats</a> and it went well, so I wanted to try my hand at keeping the \u201cclick denial\u201d aspect of the deck and update it for current cards.</p>\n\n<p>The deck is called iPod Shuffle, both as a homage to my \u201cJukebox\u201d deck from last year, and also because with Mythic ice + more than 1 grid, there tends to be a lot of \u201cshuffling\u201d.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Card Choices:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ice:</strong>  All Mythic ice suite + Border Control \u2013 my bet was that not all Runners would have sufficient answers to break MoGo / Loki, and even if they do you have ways to stop them or score out while they find the answers.</p>\n\n<p>The ideal ice placement is MoGo on the remote, Loki on HQ or R&amp;D and then Excalibur/Border Control on the other central.  Depending on what type of AI they have will determine which is which.  Having a CVS in the bin can effectively shut down Turtle as well.</p>\n\n<p>Rime was amazing for a few things\u2026 DDoS, Inside Job are worthless if you can get a Rime on the outside in front of your MoGo.  Rime messes with turtle &amp; Atman math as well.  It can also prevent a Hippo of a Border Control if you have Rime on the outside.</p>\n\n<p>Border Control paired with Mythic is pretty sweet.  Some cool encounters are letting an Excalibur Fire and then ETR w Border Control so they can\u2019t run again.  Or if they use a Pelangi counter to break Mogo and you have a BC behind it so you can ETR and they can\u2019t use Pelangi again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Upgrades:</strong> The Jinja\u2019s accelerate your ice installs and allow for an Asa trigger of key upgrades which is very nice click compression.  Crisium is for the key run events and Apoc.  Cyberdex is for stuffing Turtle and Pelangi.  Mason Bellamy is a great way to close out games if you have an ELP out or they need to steal an Ikawah.  Calibration Testing in Asa is sweet with Project Vitruvius, as you can install the PV, Asa the Calibration and score it from hand (basically a Biotic Labor) or you just install advance a 5/3 and use the other click to do something else.  Embolus was the last piece of \u201cgetting the lockout\u201d if you put it behind the Excalibur (or in the remote) if they are relying on Turtle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Card draw:</strong> the clearances are great with Jinja and getting through your deck, as well as money sometimes.  Rashida has the same effect.</p>\n\n<p><strong>ELP:</strong> always a favorite of mine, it\u2019s the star when you\u2019re making the runner do click math as well as credit math for trying to steal agendas.  It also helps with Apoc and farming Turtle counters.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the deck was really fun to play, the biggest issue was not the runners having answers to the Mythic suite, but more that I didn\u2019t have enough money in certain games to rez all the key things I needed.  Diversion of Funds stopped me cold in 2 games, and Wanton Destruction was a problem as well.  If I had found my Crisiums earlier maybe I would have done better.</p>\n", "user_id": 27303, "user_name": "pj20", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11080": 1, "11111": 2, "12069": 2, "12112": 1, "21009": 1, "21010": 3, "21017": 1, "21031": 3, "21038": 2, "21080": 3, "25068": 3, "25083": 1, "25139": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26037": 2, "26065": 3, "28003": 1, "28005": 3, "06010": 3, "06022": 3, "06111": 2, "07027": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57605": {"id": 57605, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T23:19:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-04T23:19:42+00:00", "name": "Fully Op Glacier Asa BC3(Nats)", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 29735, "user_name": "profDEADPOOL", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11049": 1, "12029": 1, "12111": 3, "21009": 1, "21010": 3, "21038": 3, "21039": 2, "21080": 2, "21118": 2, "22029": 2, "23045": 1, "23054": 3, "25068": 1, "25073": 2, "25077": 2, "25082": 2, "25083": 3, "25139": 1, "25146": 3, "26034": 2, "26036": 3, "26065": 1, "06022": 3, "06061": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57606": {"id": 57606, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T23:19:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-04T23:21:09+00:00", "name": "Stargate/Wanton Eater Maxx", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 29735, "user_name": "profDEADPOOL", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 1, "11042": 2, "11081": 2, "21103": 3, "25007": 2, "25009": 3, "25010": 2, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "26004": 2, "03035": 2, "03038": 3, "03053": 3, "03054": 3, "06073": 2, "07029": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 3, "07040": 2, "08021": 2, "09035": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57607": {"id": 57607, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T23:19:58+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-04T23:19:58+00:00", "name": "Recurring Punishment mod", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 29735, "user_name": "profDEADPOOL", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"25072": 2, "25073": 1, "25079": 1, "25085": 1, "25086": 2, "25087": 2, "25088": 1, "25089": 1, "25090": 1, "25091": 2, "25092": 1, "25093": 1, "25094": 1, "25095": 1, "25096": 1, "25097": 1, "25098": 1, "25099": 2, "25100": 2, "25101": 2, "25102": 1, "25103": 2, "25108": 1, "25115": 2, "25138": 2, "25139": 1, "25140": 2, "25141": 2, "25142": 2, "25143": 2, "25145": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57608": {"id": 57608, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T23:19:58+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-04T23:19:58+00:00", "name": "System Core Leela mod", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 29735, "user_name": "profDEADPOOL", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"25005": 1, "25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25011": 2, "25015": 1, "25017": 2, "25018": 1, "25021": 1, "25023": 2, "25024": 1, "25025": 1, "25026": 2, "25027": 2, "25029": 1, "25030": 2, "25032": 2, "25033": 2, "25034": 1, "25035": 2, "25036": 2, "25037": 1, "25038": 2, "25050": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 2, "25062": 2, "25063": 2, "25064": 1, "25065": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57609": {"id": 57609, "date_creation": "2019-11-04T23:49:56+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T01:59:27+00:00", "name": "Long Rod Mirrormorph", "description": "<p>Just that Mirrormorph deck I've been running for a while.

Some are similar, others changed drastically.</p>\n\n<p>Following are the requirements:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Cards from SanSan and forward, excluding Revised Core. At the time of writing, this does not include Uprising. IDs may be OK, if one fits the idea of the deck well.</li>\n<li>Only cards from the faction itself and neutral cards are allowed.</li>\n<li>Decks should be representative of the faction's style.</li>\n<li>If many styles could be expressed by one faction, try to avoid cramming them all in just for demonstration's sake.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, have a look at what can be built with just a System Core, and extrapolate from there.</li>\n<li>Use MWL as a list of cards to generally avoid.</li>\n<li>Generally stick to Netrunner basics. Subsequently, avoid gimmicks and exotic combos.</li>\n</ol><p>This may stray away from the original ideas of TheBigBoy, but his work was much appreciated when building these decks.</p>\n", "user_id": 12323, "user_name": "linduxed", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10092": 1, "11094": 3, "12115": 3, "21038": 3, "22043": 1, "25105": 1, "25107": 3, "25108": 2, "25112": 3, "25114": 3, "25115": 2, "25116": 2, "25117": 1, "25119": 1, "25120": 2, "25121": 2, "25142": 3, "25143": 2, "25146": 3, "26049": 3, "09004": 1, "09013": 2, "09027": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57577": {"id": 57577, "date_creation": "2019-11-01T16:46:53+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-03T09:30:13+00:00", "name": "Whose Agenda Is It Anyway?

The deck where the points are all made up and the agendas don't matter!</p>\n\n<p>This is an evolution of skry's Real Fake Points deck from a few months ago. Like his original, this deck went 3-0 at a NYC GNK and is also undefeated in 5 games on JNet.</p>\n\n<p>There's not a whole lot to say that wasn't said in the original writeup but here are the main changes:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>The agenda suite has been shuffled a little to include <a href=\"/en/card/26096\">Megaprix Qualifier</a>. Megaprix is bonkers good in Sports decks. It increases the total number of points available to you to score by 2 without giving a boost to the runner. This means that 22 are available for your use while they only get 17 thanks to GFI.</p></li>\n<li><p>I traded the <a href=\"/en/card/11019\">Stock Buy-Back</a>s for some <a href=\"/en/card/11094\">IP Block</a>s and <a href=\"/en/card/23045\">Slot Machine</a>s. They're good cards, Bront. the IP Blocks are definitely flex slots though and I can see dropping them for one Stock Buy-Back and maybe some <a href=\"/en/card/22028\">Meridian</a>s or <a href=\"/en/card/12029\">Seidr Adaptive Barrier</a>s. I honestly forgot Meridian existed until this moment so.</p></li>\n<li><p>Other ICE changes were because the deck felt a little porous. I ditched the FC2 for <a href=\"/en/card/22029\">Gatekeeper</a>s to give a solid ETR just in case you need to score behind a gearcheck if they aren't taking your News Teams for some reason (I'm looking at you, Liza players). Seidr would also help with this.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/11011\">Sherlock 2.0</a> is still a bad card so I didn't include it.</p></li>\n</ul><p>It's beaten a gamut of decks so far. At the GNK it beat OnTheNightRain's Adam, tcody's MaxX (even after he milled 10 cards or something off my deck) and Ryan's Freedom.

Be wary of sinking too many clicks in to the latter, and click intensive cards like <a href=\"/en/card/11026\">Tem\u00fcjin Contract</a> can actually set you back if you focus too much on them.

Ideally you\u2019ll combine two events from one score using either an <a href=\"/en/card/01081\">AstroScript Pilot Program</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan City Grid</a>; <a href=\"/en/card/01084\">Closed Accounts</a> in to either <a href=\"/en/card/10092\">Exchange of Information</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/11016\">Hard-Hitting News</a> can be back-breaking for the runner. </p>\n\n<p>Be careful with your ice placement; you\u2019ll often want to leave <a href=\"/en/card/09013\">Archangel</a> in hand or ideally in R&amp;D to protect against <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a>. Be aware of the sheer economic power of <a href=\"/en/card/11026\">Tem\u00fcjin Contract</a> and look to limit its impact wherever possible; the worst case scenario is that it\u2019s giving the runner credits, accesses, <a href=\"/en/card/01008\">Datasucker</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> counters and <a href=\"/en/card/11041\">Obelus</a> draws all at the same time. If you can get the runner to accept tags then the game is half won, but be aware that you can lose to <a href=\"/en/card/01010\">Medium</a> very quickly so don\u2019t assume anything. <a href=\"/en/card/04015\">Jackson Howard</a> will usually shuffle tag punishment, political assets or <a href=\"/en/card/01092\">SanSan City Grid</a>s, as required. Remember that your <a href=\"/en/card/11017\">ID ability</a> is optional (so you have to declare that you\u2019re using it!) and fires if the runner trashes your ice with <a href=\"/en/card/01012\">Parasite</a>.</p>\n", "user_id": 25602, "user_name": "3N1GM4", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10053": 3, "10054": 2, "10074": 1, "10076": 2, "10092": 2, "11016": 2, "11017": 1, "25107": 3, "25114": 2, "25115": 2, "25117": 2, "25118": 1, "25142": 1, "25143": 1, "25146": 3, "01081": 1, "01082": 3, "01092": 2, "04015": 3, "04076": 3, "09013": 2, "09015": 3, "09018": 2, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57567": {"id": 57567, "date_creation": "2019-10-30T16:22:34+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-12T12:23:18+00:00", "name": "The Journey Deck (1st @ Polish Nationals)", "description": "<p>The AgInf deck that went 5-2 on the way to winning Polish Nationals. The description is going to get sentimental, but I don't care. It feels like so many of the learnings from the awesome 6 year Netrunner journey are in this deck. Learnings from the countless games, but most importantly from other runners.</p>\n\n<p>I needed a Corp for Nationals as I knew I could not play PE. Not pecause it's not good: I knew that @Odol and @apo would be among the guys to beat, both knowing the list inside out and both running enough annoying counters to make them heavily favored against it.</p>\n\n<p>Palanas proved very strong @Worlds, there were a couple of AgInf lists high in the standings as well, that reassured me that scoring Jinteki can work against the top runners. AgInf always felt stronger to me, I have a soft spot for the ID since the release, I just needed to find a way to solve econ. Top worlds lists ran Daily Quest, which I did not like. The remote is where I like to keep my agendas so I had to find another way.</p>\n\n<p>Below's an incomplete list of card choice inspirations:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>SSL Endorsement: @Odol was spectating my Val vs AgInf game in the top cut of worlds and told me that stealing an SSL from R&amp;D lost me that game. I believe he was right. Hence a deck that aims to put an SSL in the game quickly. It's more important than the Nisei's. If you can score it or engineer a situation where the runner commits resources to stealing it early, you're likely to come out ahead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Medical Research Fundraiser: @Selverin played it in plenty of different Jinteki decks over the years and once told me \u201cmy money is more important than your money\u201d when I asked him why. I might be much fonder of denying runner\u2019s creds, but the card does massive work here. It has a meaningful downside, but you only have to suffer it the benefit outweighs it. It\u2019s a lot better than Celebrity Gifts that are one of Netrunner\u2019s most overrated cards.</p></li>\n<li><p>Macrophage: @Smieszny brought a Titan deck with Macrophage to Worlds. I was doubtful about the card, the deck had its ups and downs, but his wins were basically a Macrophage highlight reel. Khumalo could get popular after Worlds (they weren't really @ Polish Nats)? A way to purge Pelangi from Shapers? Criminals relying on Turtles? I'm Aginf so I can get away with specialized ICE choices? It proved very strong and the 2 copies won the key game against the very @Smieszny who inspired the card by purging his Pelangi and taxing his Smoke on R&amp;D accesses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Thimblerig: I remember arguing with @Asertus, @Odol and a bunch of other guys that Thimblerigs are ok, but are basically inferior Quandaries and the ability is almost irrelevant. I take that back, the ability matters in this deck, you do not need to worry about positioning your Excaliburs and other situational ICE. Just install them where you need them at the moment and even a single Thimblerig will be able to fix your ICE placement later down the line. They also annoy the hell out of Orchestra players.</p></li>\n<li><p>Jinja City Grid: my favorite, beloved, extremely underrated pet card. It saves plenty of clicks, credits and enables servers that would be too expensive to build. It does amazing work here and in so many other scoring decks. Jinja &gt; La Costa, you won\u2019t convince me otherwise :)</p></li>\n</ul><p>This must be one of the strongest decks around right now. I\u2019m sure the list can be fine-tuned and there definitely is an extremely high skill cap with all the Jinja, AgInf &amp; Thimblerig triggers. Play it &amp; have fun, scoring AgInf is my personal favorite Corp to play. Pursuing the dream of winning Polish Nationals has been one hell of a journey. Getting here with a deck that has so many of the learnings collected around the way in it just feels great.</p>\n\n<p>PS: The journey does not end here, there\u2019s plenty of Netrunner to be played.

The only exceptions were the cards present in System Core 2019.</p>\n\n<p>As a challenge (and to satisfy my preferences) I decided to take each teaching deck made by TheBigBoy and use them as inspiration for a new set of decks. Some are similar, others changed drastically.</p>\n\n<p>Following are the requirements:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Cards from SanSan and forward, excluding Revised Core. At the time of writing, this does not include Uprising. IDs may be OK, if one fits the idea of the deck well.</li>\n<li>Only cards from the faction itself and neutral cards are allowed.</li>\n<li>Decks should be representative of the faction's style.</li>\n<li>If many styles could be expressed by one faction, try to avoid cramming them all in just for demonstration's sake.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, have a look at what can be built with just a System Core, and extrapolate from there.</li>\n<li>Use MWL as a list of cards to generally avoid.</li>\n<li>Generally stick to Netrunner basics. Subsequently, avoid gimmicks and exotic combos.</li>\n</ol><p>This may stray away from the original ideas of TheBigBoy, but his work was much appreciated when building these decks.</p>\n", "user_id": 12323, "user_name": "linduxed", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11030": 2, "12088": 1, "21107": 2, "25041": 1, "25042": 3, "25043": 2, "25045": 3, "25046": 3, "25047": 2, "25048": 3, "25049": 2, "25050": 3, "25051": 2, "25052": 1, "25053": 1, "25054": 2, "25058": 3, "25059": 3, "25065": 2, "26026": 3, "26027": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57555": {"id": 57555, "date_creation": "2019-10-29T23:23:32+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-29T23:23:32+00:00", "name": "Blue Sun test", "description": "\n", "user_id": 34187, "user_name": "bonborat", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11016": 3, "11060": 2, "11097": 1, "11112": 3, "12098": 1, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "21119": 3, "22054": 3, "22055": 3, "25123": 1, "25126": 1, "25133": 1, "25137": 3, "25146": 3, "26056": 3, "26058": 2, "28005": 3, "07015": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57544": {"id": 57544, "date_creation": "2019-10-28T01:03:28+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-28T07:53:26+00:00", "name": "Wacky Weylie's Fun Park! v.2.3", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 26740, "user_name": "Atomikrin", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10017": 2, "10036": 1, "11038": 1, "11080": 2, "11097": 1, "12059": 1, "12080": 3, "12118": 2, "21012": 2, "21020": 3, "21038": 2, "21039": 3, "21058": 2, "21078": 2, "21099": 3, "22038": 1, "25133": 3, "25134": 2, "26056": 2, "27007": 2, "03009": 2, "05015": 1, "06050": 1, "07013": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57546": {"id": 57546, "date_creation": "2019-10-28T10:46:02+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-11T16:09:40+00:00", "name": "Damon's Last Ride", "description": "<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/mTtIhG6.jpg\" width=\"500\" alt=\"mTtIhG6.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update: currently 55-19 for a 74% winrate</strong></p>\n\n<p>This deck is a slightly tweaked version of an <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56860/damon-s-last-ride\">earlier</a> deck I posted. The core combo of the deck is still using Mason Bellamy with basically any subset of (Border Control, Heinlein Grid, Ikawah Project) to create \"unbeatable\" remotes.   </p>\n\n<p>Since I posted this deck, I cut a piece of ice, an Archived Memories and an agenda for 3x Lateral Growth. These have been really good, especially with the second change: swapping BLC for VLC. I've no excuse for not doing this before, I just kinda forgot that VLC wasn't banned. In combination, Lateral Growth and VLC allow you to efficiently empty your hand and refill it. It's very tempting to put in some AAL too for even more of this effect. </p>\n\n<p>I also generally made the ice slightly less expensive. There are a lot of money cards in here, but as your gameplan sometimes involves putting 3 pieces of ice on the remote, you also spend it fast. Drawing a ton and filling HQ up with agendas doesn't help either. For this reason, Vanilla is pretty good.  Nice as an early gearcheck, but also pretty good late when you need a 3rd Mason trigger to put on the remote, and something like Hagen would be too expensive.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, I think I'm slightly more confident in this deck than I used to be. It's definitely kinda reliant on a good draw, but with no Jackson I feel that's just Netrunner right now. I think if I could figure out the Apocalypse matchup (I think the deck has the cards for it with Border Control and Mason, but I've yet to reliably do so, so I'm probably too optimistic) it might legitimately become a good deck, but currently I can't, and good players trying to Apocalypse me generally win.</p>\n", "user_id": 2029, "user_name": "presheaf", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10037": 1, "10095": 2, "10104": 3, "11049": 3, "11111": 3, "21009": 1, "21010": 3, "21038": 1, "21080": 3, "22029": 2, "23054": 3, "25068": 3, "25073": 2, "25076": 1, "25077": 2, "25079": 1, "25080": 1, "25083": 3, "25100": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "06023": 2, "06061": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.1"}, "57547": {"id": 57547, "date_creation": "2019-10-28T16:35:45+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-29T16:57:13+00:00", "name": "Generic Los deck", "description": "<p>Just to show that Los is an ID.

England won their Rugby World Cup semi-final, Reading's match against Forest was postponed (a surefire, if shortsighted, way to avoid defeat), probably some other stuff happened, and this SportsMetal deck went 4-0 at a GNK.</p>\n\n<p>Not a huge accomplishment perhaps, but this is the same deck that I also piloted 4-0 to 5th out of 23 at the Bristol regional. That's EIGHT whole games without loss! It has also won BOTH friendly games that I've played with it. Pretty incredible.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the deck: It's a Jinja Sports deck that kind of speeds up and slows down to suit the gamestate. No 1- or 0-pointers in sight here, this isn't a combo deck, nor does it fall back on Game Changer and the like. The Sports ability is only fired to keep the tempo up.</p>\n\n<p>When you're on the defensive, get a Jinja down, play a VLC and build a remote, stick an Ash in it. When you're ready, it's time to break! Jam an agenda in the remote and force the runner to respond. If they have tricks and can stretch their resources to get in, you've just earned a window for the next agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Trigger Sports for draw if you're looking for the next agenda, or want ICE for Jinja.</p>\n\n<p>Punitive provides a great line if you can force the Runner to expend cards and money stretching for an agenda they probably should have left alone.</p>\n\n<p>A quick note about Jinja: it's a trap. Do not snap-install ICE you draw on the remote, but think carefully about where you want your ICE (this applies to all games really, but it's easy to forget with a rezzed Jinja). You probably want Architects and Slot Machines on centrals, so don't Jinja-install them except in exceptional circumstances. Surveyors, Seidrs and the first Fairchild belong on the remote ideally.</p>\n\n<p>A small note about Vitruvius too: Unless it's going to win you the game, try to always score Vitruvius with at least one counter. Vitruvius counters go a long way with the likes of Punitive and Biotic in a deck, or more general recursion in a pinch.</p>\n\n<p>Shout outs to: Rotage (it is essentially his deck) and Catherine (who lent me 40+ cards to play it in Bristol)</p>\n", "user_id": 1221, "user_name": "johno", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10037": 3, "11049": 2, "11111": 3, "12029": 3, "21031": 3, "21039": 1, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "22026": 1, "23045": 2, "25068": 3, "25079": 1, "25080": 1, "25082": 3, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26035": 3, "05027": 1, "06061": 3, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57537": {"id": 57537, "date_creation": "2019-10-27T18:05:10+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-27T18:05:10+00:00", "name": "[TBB-Mod] Teaching Criminal", "description": "<p>The deck seeks to encourage running, so lots of credits and plenty of events.</p>\n\n<p>No fancy breakers, to keep it standard.</p>\n\n<h1>About [TBB-Mod]</h1>\n\n<p>In preparing for a Netrunner event for beginners, I needed to build some decks that would both be fun to play with and that would demonstrate each faction's style.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for me, TheBigBoy built seven teaching decks and wrote two articles describing the decks:</p>\n\n<ul><li>https://runthenet.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/recommended-teachinglearning-decks/</li>\n<li>https://runthenet.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/teaching-and-learning-jinteki-deck/</li>\n</ul><p>However, I decided against using the decks unmodified.</p>\n\n<p>I had recently gone through my collection and stashed away every card from a set that's older than the SanSan cycle (including C&amp;C, H&amp;P, and O&amp;C), in an effort to modernize the card pool.

October 2019:</strong> <em>I've been away from Netrunner for almost a year now. While prepping for some casual games this week I found this old decklist. Normally I'd just let it be, but since sometime in the unknown past I felt the need to write 1500 words about this sucker, I feel like I'd hate for them to go to waste. So here, enjoy a snapshot of history, for whatever it's worth.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Original Writeup, Sep 2018 (?)</strong>\nOne Saturday morning last December, I woke up from a dream about <a href=\"/en/card/12042\">Persephone</a>. I don't really know why. I hadn't been playing Netrunner that much over the preceding 6 months, and while I had purchased most of the Red Sands cycle, I hadn't really looked at them that closely, and was definitely in a lull in my relationship with Netrunner. And yet, I woke up vividly thinking about this killer that everyone agrees is \"pretty terrible.\" I can only assume that this was a prophetic inspiration from on high (Boggs be praised). I began to jot down ideas.</p>\n\n<p>By that afternoon, the deck had (surprisingly) taken a nice little 6-game win streak. By that Tuesday, the decklist was solidified, and wouldn't change for about 3 months. <a href=\"/en/card/12042\">Persephone</a> redefined my relationship with Netrunner. I've now been playing <a href=\"/en/card/12042\">Persephone</a> decks for 9 months, and have never looked back. I even won a small <a href=\"https://alwaysberunning.net/tournaments/1140/android-netrunner-gnk\">GNK</a> with one. </p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yW7D324.png\" alt=\"Imgur\" /></p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VMXmUkC.png\" alt=\"Imgur\" /></p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GZ4mrDF.png\" alt=\"Imgur\" /></p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5Ndzqj3.png\" alt=\"Imgur\" /></p>\n\n<p>No, the stats aren't <em>incredible</em>, but the enlightened Persephone player isn't here to win every game with tryhard lists and laser precision. The enlightened player is here to make a mess of R&amp;D and leave their opponents in flabbergasted confusion. </p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/53lN577WPCFGM/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Confused\" /></p>\n\n<p>You might win a little better than half your games, and that's alright- you're going to love every minute of it (or not, I don't dictate your experiences).</p>\n\n<p>After 9 months of playing Persephone-runner, I think this is one of the most successful iterations of my own little private archetype- so let's look at the list:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Influence</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is pretty static, and hasn't changed too much between iterations, though the recent MWL mixed things up a bit. Maxx wants at least one <a href=\"/en/card/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access</a> at the best of times. Persephone Maxx wants two. You might not need both Levies to win the game, but if things really get rolling on the Persephone-train (hereafter P-train), you don't want to be caught without the second one. This is the first iteration of the deck to run less than three <a href=\"/en/card/13019\">Egret</a>. I went down to two to make room for two <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a>. The Clone Chips are there to get back either your Persephone or your Egret as needed. I also used to run <a href=\"/en/card/10085\">The Turning Wheel</a>, but found that once you've got the P-train rolling, or are making sufficient use of the other pressure cards in the deck, that's your multi-access. The final pip of influence goes to <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>. I used to run <a href=\"/en/card/08023\">Career Fair</a> in the deck, but in shuffling the influence around to make room for Clone Chip, there was only one inf remaining. Career Fair is virtually useless as a one-of, so Aumakua it is. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Breakers</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apart from Persephone, these shouldn't be too surprising. You're playing Maxx, heap breakers are helpful when so many cards are going through your heap. Notably, we're all-in on the Persephone plan, however. That means no additional backup killers. The single copy of Aumakua can be targeted with Clone Chip if necessary, and helps counteract some of the expense of breaking expensive code gates or sentries with must-break subs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Persephone</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think the thing to understand about playing a P-train deck is that you aren't going to count on Persephone for the win. It is part of a toolkit of other pressure cards, which together will help you close games in your favor. You don't spend the game trying to dig through the stack and achieve the perfect setup. Persephone often helps you over the edge, but it's not the entire key to winning the game. This deck doesn't have a lynchpin combo or setup it needs to close out- instead it consists of money, breakers, and pressure cards. Persephone helps as both a breaker and a pressure card. Notably, <a href=\"/en/card/13019\">Egret</a> helps a lot to find you openings for P-train mills. It can turn vulnerable code gates, barriers, and mythic ice into mill opportunities. Likewise, there will be some sentries which you actually <em>want</em> to break (crazy, I know). In these circumstances you don't want to break with Perseph for obvious reasons- then you throw an Egret down and break for <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a> value. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Econ Suite</strong></p>\n\n<p>These are fairly vanilla, and resemble a typical Anarch suite. I don't think there's anything surprising or worth commenting on especially. The one thing that I will note is that this deck is usually starving for cash, so playing as many econ cards as you can (even if it means a slight drop in tempo) is usually worth it to carry you through the midgame.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Tech</strong></p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, this deck isn't designed to cheese out a win with Persephone alone. Rather, it's constructed to lay down a lot of pressure across the board- every central, every remote can help you get closer to victory, which means that the Corp will often struggle to stay ahead on protecting itself from potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Maw is terrific value for this deck, since you want to run a lot. Whether it's running remotes against asset spam or farming a server which is already giving you P-train mills, it's an undeniable hero in the deck.</p></li>\n<li><p>Bhagat encourages the Corp to protect HQ, often at the cost of leaving more servers underprotected. This is a recent addition to the list, and really helps maintain the constant aggression you need to keep the Corp on the back foot. </p></li>\n<li><p>Spoilers is also essential. You're going to need time to set up economically during the early game, and getting one or two of these down can be super disruptive.</p></li>\n<li><p>Freedom Through Equality: This deck used to wait until it had milled sufficiently, and then Mad Dash Archives praying for the win. Now you can spend 3 credits and an extra click for pretty much the same effect. However, it does help a little in that you can clear a Scarcity of Resources if you need to. Further, on the turn that you try to close out the game, it can be nice to play this click one, run HQ for Bhagat/Maw value, run R&amp;D to check the deck, and then close out on Archives. It marginally improves your odds of accessing the agenda you need.</p></li>\n<li><p>Street Peddler can be awkward (losing three events, especially a Levy, will make you cry).  However, it's an important part of the deck for increasing your speed and consistency. It can pop a surprise Egret, Spoilers, or Maw; most importantly, at instant-speed. You often want to wait to drop the Egret until the very last moment, therefore the speed of a Peddler can really help you a lot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Clone Chip, like Peddler, can give you instant-speed Egret windows. Further, it helps the deck's consistency in the cases where your Maxx mills dump critical pieces (Persephone, Aumakua) into your heap.</p></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Ok, but how do I play your dumb deck?</strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/6jlup.jpg\" alt=\"HowWork\" /></p>\n\n<p>Unlike the <a href=\"/en/card/02103\">Data Leak Reversal</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/01001\">Noise: Hacker Extraordinaire</a> reversal decks of yesteryear, or even the <a href=\"/en/card/21083\">Contaminate</a>/<a href=\"/en/card/07041\">Gravedigger</a> decks which occasionally pop up now, this deck is going to involve some interacting with the Corp. You can't sit back and spend your turn clicking to mill the deck. Those decks would play a solitaire game and mill the deck until one player won. The essential NPE element of those decks was that the corp felt like they were left out of the game while the runner could easily win the game without effort or thought. </p>\n\n<p>Not so with Persephone, my friend, not so with Persephone. Every game is going to require careful thought. Your deck is going to cough up something different every time, and you're going to have to be flexible depending on what you draw and what your matchup is. In some games, Persephone will absolutely win you the game. In others, you'll never install it.</p>\n\n<p>Against rush and glacier, you typically want to get your Spoilers down as quickly as possible, and capitalize on its passive pressure while you set up your rig.</p>\n\n<p>Against kill, Bhagat, Maw, and econ are your friends. It's harder for them to land an HHN if you knock out the cards they need and keep your money up.</p>\n\n<p>Against fast advance, you again rely on Spoilers, but you need to run a lot more to knock out Biotics, etc. and try to snipe agendas off R&amp;D before the corp can see them. </p>\n\n<p>And against any corp, you look for useful opportunities to trigger Persephone. You're looking for a variety of ice here. Jinteki's sentries can be useful (Komainu, Cortex Lock,  even Anansi- sort of). But to make the most of the P-train, you're going to need a little help from your Egrets. You want especially to see porous code gates like Mausolus, DNA Tracker, Miraju, Pop-Up Window, and all of the Fairchildren save 3.0. The more subroutines, the better. However, when the subs are lower-impact (as with Miraju and Pop-Up Window), you might want to plant the Egret just to to be able to repeatedly hammer the server.

These are decks that people brought to the most competitive tournament of 2019: The world championship in Rotterdam!\nOn the Corp side we've arrived at <em>2 Grid for 2 Place</em>, which was played by <code>@Testrunning</code> to a first place finish at the Crown of Lasers side event as well as the second place in the main event. The final additions are <a href=\"/en/card/11094\">IP Block</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/07027\">Cyberdex Virus Suite</a> (short CVS), the first of which is comparable to <a href=\"/en/card/25145\">Wall of Static</a> in this matchup, but gives much needed punishment to AI breakers like <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>. CVS does fit the same role in protecting Archives against farming Aumakua tokens. In this matchup it doubles as a way of purging <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> mid-run and forcing a use of <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the Runner side we've got <em>Surfing Rainbows (for value)</em> built by <code>@qvm</code> and myself. While I myself only managed to get 106th place, <code>@qvm</code> and <code>@HerbartKlopstock</code> placed 10th and 65th with it. It swaps two of the <a href=\"/en/card/25048\">Akamatsu Mem Chips</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/06079\">Astrolabe</a>, which together with <a href=\"/en/card/03045\">Paricia</a> shores up the Asset spam matchup considerably and both can be sold to Aesop's if they should not be needed. Furthermore, we've got <a href=\"/en/card/08001\">Clot</a> for the Weyland matchup, which can be very hard to stop once they get to 5 points and can use <a href=\"/en/card/12058\">Audacity</a> to score the final 2 points for the win. And finally there is <a href=\"/en/card/11085\">Misdirection</a> to protect us against <a href=\"/en/card/11016\">Hard-Hitting News</a>, which you should already know from the previous iteration of Project CROW.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding game play not much has changed since level 3. The newly included cards are mostly for shoring up all the other matchups, that I have neglected while building these duel decks.</p>\n\n<p>Once again: Congratulations! You started out with decks near to the Core Experience and followed a path to end up with strong decks in the current meta. I hope, I managed to show you a few interesting cards and decisions in this matchup. There's many more to learn and I'm sure a lot of experienced players would love to play this matchup with you. Feel free to join the #beginners channel on Stimslack and/or DM me under <code>@lostgeek</code>. With your newly gained knowledge, you can also create and join lobbies on jinteki.net to battle against other decks. There's a lot to learn in those matchups too, but with the experience of at least 4 matches, you should be prepared a little bit more for those games!</p>\n", "user_id": 24742, "user_name": "lostgeek", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10043": 1, "11030": 1, "11085": 1, "22019": 1, "25007": 2, "25010": 1, "25027": 1, "25042": 2, "25048": 1, "25050": 2, "25056": 3, "25058": 3, "25059": 3, "26025": 3, "03038": 3, "03044": 2, "03045": 2, "03046": 3, "03053": 3, "06037": 3, "06079": 2, "08001": 1, "08025": 1, "08102": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57510": {"id": 57510, "date_creation": "2019-10-23T21:07:22+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T18:30:23+00:00", "name": "[Project CROW 2 - L4] 2 Grid for 2 Place", "description": "<h1>Project CROW</h1>\n\n<p>This deck is part of the second iteration of the Project CROW mini-campaign for beginners familiar with System Core 2019.

These are decks that people brought to the most competitive tournament of 2019: The world championship in Rotterdam!\nOn the Corp side we've arrived at <em>2 Grid for 2 Place</em>, which was played by <code>@Testrunning</code> to a first place finish at the Crown of Lasers side event as well as the second place in the main event. The final additions are <a href=\"/en/card/11094\">IP Block</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/07027\">Cyberdex Virus Suite</a> (short CVS), the first of which is comparable to <a href=\"/en/card/25145\">Wall of Static</a> in this matchup, but gives much needed punishment to AI breakers like <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>. CVS does fit the same role in protecting Archives against farming Aumakua tokens. In this matchup it doubles as a way of purging <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> mid-run and forcing a use of <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the Runner side we've got <em>Surfing Rainbows (for value)</em> built by <code>@qvm</code> and myself. While I myself only managed to get 106th place, <code>@qvm</code> and <code>@HerbartKlopstock</code> placed 10th and 65th with it. It swaps two of the <a href=\"/en/card/25048\">Akamatsu Mem Chips</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/06079\">Astrolabe</a>, which together with <a href=\"/en/card/03045\">Paricia</a> shores up the Asset spam matchup considerably and both can be sold to Aesop's if they should not be needed. Furthermore, we've got <a href=\"/en/card/08001\">Clot</a> for the Weyland matchup, which can be very hard to stop once they get to 5 points and can use <a href=\"/en/card/12058\">Audacity</a> to score the final 2 points for the win. And finally there is <a href=\"/en/card/11085\">Misdirection</a> to protect us against <a href=\"/en/card/11016\">Hard-Hitting News</a>, which you should already know from the previous iteration of Project CROW.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding game play not much has changed since level 3. The newly included cards are mostly for shoring up all the other matchups, that I have neglected while building these duel decks.</p>\n\n<p>Once again: Congratulations! You started out with decks near to the Core Experience and followed a path to end up with strong decks in the current meta. I hope, I managed to show you a few interesting cards and decisions in this matchup. There's many more to learn and I'm sure a lot of experienced players would love to play this matchup with you. Feel free to join the #beginners channel on Stimslack and/or DM me under <code>@lostgeek</code>. With your newly gained knowledge, you can also create and join lobbies on jinteki.net to battle against other decks. There's a lot to learn in those matchups too, but with the experience of at least 4 matches, you should be prepared a little bit more for those games!</p>\n", "user_id": 24742, "user_name": "lostgeek", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10030": 1, "11053": 1, "11060": 3, "11094": 3, "12070": 3, "21038": 1, "21039": 3, "21051": 3, "21072": 3, "21080": 3, "22039": 2, "25087": 3, "25088": 1, "25100": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "27005": 3, "28004": 3, "28005": 3, "06111": 2, "07027": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57511": {"id": 57511, "date_creation": "2019-10-23T21:07:29+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T18:30:23+00:00", "name": "[Project CROW 2 - L3] Cowabunga, dude!", "description": "<h1>Project CROW</h1>\n\n<p>This deck is part of the second iteration of the Project CROW mini-campaign for beginners familiar with System Core 2019.

Most cards were replaced by their most efficient variants and allow a variety of lines of play.</p>\n\n<p>The Corporation got some more tools as well as some nasty pieces of ice. Starting with the tools, we've got <a href=\"/en/card/21072\">Bio Vault</a>, which can either work to bait the Runner into an expensive run or - if they don't bite - as a means to stop a run later on. Together with <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a> this can make runs very much impossible, if not dealt with by the Runner.</p>\n\n<p>The second tool is <a href=\"/en/card/11060\">Scarcity of Resources</a>, which can be used to slow down the Runner considerably. When under Scarcity, the Runner has to really think hard about whether installing that <a href=\"/en/card/03053\">Daily Casts</a> is really worth it (often enough it is not).</p>\n\n<p>Finally we've got the three pieces of ice in <a href=\"/en/card/11053\">DNA Tracker</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/21051\">Anansi</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/22039\">Thimblerig</a>. While the first two might seem very nasty, the third one is one of the most impressive pieces of ice released. At only 2<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> rez cost it does something that was only possible in very janky ways before: reposition ice. You have a costly and taxing piece of ice on the remote, but no agenda ready to score? Shift around those ice to put it on a central instead and wait for later. Be sure to familiarize yourself with time timing chart: You have to activate <a href=\"/en/card/22039\">Thimblerig</a> <em>before</em> your mandatory draw, so you can't use that information to decide where to place your ice.</p>\n\n<p>On the Runner side we have an interesting tool in <a href=\"/en/card/08102\">Surfer</a>. This limits the usability of cards like <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a>, since it allows the Runner to \"surf\" the Border Control down the server, once encountered without encountering any of the other pieces of ice. If this should prove too powerful in your games, feel free to replace it with a third copy of <a href=\"/en/card/03044\">Cyber-Cypher</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Runner Part</h2>\n\n<p>As an answer to <a href=\"/en/card/11060\">Scarcity of Resources</a> on the Corp side, this deck runs a very slim suite of resources. You will have to install <a href=\"/en/card/25056\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25058\">Professional Contacts</a> even if Scarcity is in play, since they will pay for themselves down the line.

It allows to score out <a href=\"/en/card/25087\">Nisei MK II</a> under the disguise of other assets. This will a whole new level of pressure on the runner.</p>\n\n<p>The second vector of attack is <a href=\"/en/card/12070\">Obokata Protocol</a>, which puts the runner under a tempo constraint. Stealing it often means spending the next 4 clicks to draw back up.</p>\n\n<p>This plays into the Corporation identity: <a href=\"/en/card/10030\">P\u0101lan\u0101 Foods: Sustainable Growth</a>, which gains 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> the first time each turn the Runner draws a card.</p>\n\n<p>The last important new addition is <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a>, which is a piece of ice with the mythic subtype. This type of ice can not be broken by normal means and its subroutine will prevent the Runner from initiating any further runs on this turn. Together with <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a>, this allows the Corporation to score out any agenda they want. To stop this from happening, the Runner deck includes 3x <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> with which they can paint any subtype on the piece of ice they're encountering. This ability being only once per turn puts the Runner in some interesting decisions on recurring Pelangi with their <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chips</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Runner Part</h2>\n\n<p>In this level the Runner breaker suite changed considerably. Besides <a href=\"/en/card/25010\">Corroder</a> we now use <a href=\"/en/card/03044\">Cyber-Cypher</a> (short Cycy) and <a href=\"/en/card/22019\">Ika</a>, which are very efficient breakers with a quirk. Cycy only works on a single server, which has to be chosen when installing it. As an upside it starts with a whopping 4 strength and is a very efficient breaker. Together with <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a>, this allows contesting even strongly iced remotes early on. <a href=\"/en/card/22019\">Ika</a> on the other hand has to be moved around constantly and is best when stationary on a single piece of problematic ice.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/en/card/25062\">Armitage Codebustings</a>, that were mostly used as fodder for <a href=\"/en/card/25056\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> in the last level were now replaced with <a href=\"/en/card/06037\">Cache</a>. This card gives you incredible value combined with the new ID <a href=\"/en/card/08025\">Hayley Kaplan: Universal Scholar</a>. With Hayley you can often play as if your turns had 5 clicks by installing the program you wanted plus a Cache, which nets you 2c directly and 3c when sold to Aesop's at the start of next turn.

It allows to score out <a href=\"/en/card/25087\">Nisei MK II</a> under the disguise of other assets. This will a whole new level of pressure on the runner.</p>\n\n<p>The second vector of attack is <a href=\"/en/card/12070\">Obokata Protocol</a>, which puts the runner under a tempo constraint. Stealing it often means spending the next 4 clicks to draw back up.</p>\n\n<p>This plays into the Corporation identity: <a href=\"/en/card/10030\">P\u0101lan\u0101 Foods: Sustainable Growth</a>, which gains 1<span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span> the first time each turn the Runner draws a card.</p>\n\n<p>The last important new addition is <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a>, which is a piece of ice with the mythic subtype. This type of ice can not be broken by normal means and its subroutine will prevent the Runner from initiating any further runs on this turn. Together with <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a>, this allows the Corporation to score out any agenda they want. To stop this from happening, the Runner deck includes 3x <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> with which they can paint any subtype on the piece of ice they're encountering. This ability being only once per turn puts the Runner in some interesting decisions on recurring Pelangi with their <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chips</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Corp Part</h2>\n\n<p>The second new piece of ice <a href=\"/en/card/28004\">Slot Machine</a> can be very taxing to break for the Runner. Use these to ice up centrals lightly early on. Then start building a remote consisting of <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a> as well as other pieces of taxing ice and force them to run in there as often as possible.</p>\n", "user_id": 24742, "user_name": "lostgeek", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10030": 1, "12070": 3, "21038": 1, "21039": 3, "21080": 3, "25087": 3, "25088": 1, "25091": 3, "25097": 2, "25100": 3, "25115": 1, "25143": 3, "25144": 2, "25145": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "27005": 3, "28004": 3, "28005": 3, "06111": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57515": {"id": 57515, "date_creation": "2019-10-23T21:07:56+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-05T18:30:23+00:00", "name": "[Project CROW 2 - L1] Sellin everything and the kitchen sink", "description": "<h1>Project CROW</h1>\n\n<p>This deck is part of the second iteration of the Project CROW mini-campaign for beginners familiar with System Core 2019.

Two of these cards are already in the System Core 19: <a href=\"/en/card/25085\">Jinteki: Replicating Perfection</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25087\">Nisei MK II</a>. The third was released as part of the Champion Cards released at Magnum Opus 2018: <a href=\"/en/card/28005\">Border Control</a>. It is an ok piece of ice with a bit of facecheck punishment, but really shines with its paid ability: it can be trashed to end the run. So whenever the runner made a run, broke everything and would access the server, it can be trashed to stop the run and force them to spend another click and money to get in again.</p>\n\n<p>The Corp can play some mind games with <a href=\"/en/card/21039\">NGO Front</a>, which was introduced in the Kitara Cycle. Like Border Control, it can be trashed as a paid ability just when the Runner would access it.

A great card from the Kitara Cycle that accelerates the Corporation by providing cards and credits.</p>\n\n<p>The Runner is a pretty standard <a href=\"/en/card/25056\">Aesop's</a> list. Find your <a href=\"/en/card/25056\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25058\">Professional Contacts</a> to then draw cards, install them and sell them afterwards for profit.

The first two cards are from Creation and Control and are the backbone of pretty much every Shaper deck since their release. SMC allows lean decklists with breakers as 1-of inclusions that are tutored when needed. With an SMC on the board, the Runner can contest the board very early on and <a href=\"/en/card/25007\">Stimhacks</a> can be used to get breakers out for \"free\".

Then start drawing for <a href=\"/en/card/25056\">Aesop's Pawnshop</a>. These two cards are the economic backbone of the deck.</p>\n\n<p>When there are 4 credits on your <a href=\"/en/card/03053\">Daily Casts</a>, you can stage your triggers in such a way that you first take off 2 credits off of Daily Casts and then sell it to Aesop's afterwards for 3 more credits. This is pretty important to always have cards to sell on board. Note: <a href=\"/en/card/25062\">Armitage Codebusting</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25057\">Ice Analyzer</a> were included mostly as cheap fodder for Aesop's.</p>\n\n<p>Your game plan is using <a href=\"/en/card/25027\">Legwork</a> to check HQ if you feel Agendas might start piling up there and <a href=\"/en/card/25050\">R&amp;D Interface</a> to pressure R&amp;D. In the best case you manage to lock R&amp;D, which means that with 2 R&amp;D Interfaces, you see the top three cards of R&amp;D.

There\u2019s already 3 Rezekis, so Khusyuk on 2s was not a bad plan. Enter Kati and Symmetrical Visage, to use both throughout the game. I applied the idea the French had to play Rebirth and decided Engolo was my restricted card. MKUltra seemed fine as a setup card with Spec Work (without PioT/Stimhack), and with Corroder I was satisfied that my support breakers costed two (I am not sorry, Gauss). As I wanted to win on Khusyuks, Escher was my card of choice to deal with Border Control. It\u2019s a bit expensive, now that I think of it, but fun to play. For memory problems there\u2019s Maya and I\u2019d try to play 3 of instead of one of the Leprechauns (because I\u2019m a coward and corps scoring SDS visit me in my nightmares).

I opted for a slow &amp; steady game to play around his kill plan and build my board state for Khusyuk, allowing my opponent to score out really quick.</p>\n\n<p>Round 2\nWin vs Mamut on ASA</p>\n\n<p>I knew this corp can outpace my Kabonesa, so seeing an early IA card I installed SMC and Stimhacked the hell out of EffCom protected by Hagen. Fortunately, the R&amp;D was left open and after a proper setup, I did a few runs for single accesses and Khusyuks for 4/5 cards that found what I was looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3\nLoss vs Baltar on Blue Sun</p>\n\n<p>My opponent got really nicely set up, scored the first City Works I couldn\u2019t contest. Welcome to mid game, he scores another one. Once I was set up, the Khusyuks didn\u2019t show a thing. I got locked out of both remote and R&amp;D and conceded.  One precious thing was Baltar\u2019s smile as he saw Escher exchanging the HQ Afshar with Border Control on R&amp;D: \u2018Oh, I haven\u2019t seen that for a while\u2019 :)</p>\n\n<p>Round 4\nLoss vs rattkin on ASA</p>\n\n<p>It was the Worlds-winning ASA that was going to rush out, right?

Quercia played around Weyland tag\u2019n\u2019bag bullshit for some time - quite not what Liza wants to do, but it worked. Eventually the outcome was the usual Weyland kill in the unfavourable matchup, but what made the game was two brave Border Controls on HQ resisting two audacious Embezzle runs in early/mid game and protecting the precious HPT.</p>\n\n<p>Round 2\nLoss vs Mamut on 419</p>\n\n<p>A very well-controlled game by my opponent. Let\u2019s say this 419 was better prepared for initiating traces than Argus - and that\u2019s always Bad News (the Hard-Hitting segment went straight to the bin). </p>\n\n<p>Round 3\nLoss vs Baltar on Adam</p>\n\n<p>I was running first and we had around 15 minutes for the second game. I had my chance and I blew it (if I remember correctly the game ended 3:4 and time was called). Find The Truth is a good card. Misdirection is good in Adam.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4\nWin vs rattkin on Hayley</p>\n\n<p>It was always hard to play with rattkin\u2019s Shaper decks. The guy is just too committed to not making mistakes! Annoying. In each and every game we played in these green vs green matchups rattkin made it to the late game and usually found 7 pts somewhere. This time I somehow managed to rush and set up the usual Argus fork, making him go tag-me with R&amp;D runs through Data Raven and I was able to land the HPT then, ending the round as a friendly split. Rattkin, if you\u2019re reading this, I refuse to believe you won\u2019t attend Netrunner competitive events anymore. Not crying, you are.</p>\n\n<p>Round 5\nWin vs Aspen on Hayley</p>\n\n<p>I rushed some points out and kept my opponent low on cash, threatening HPT kill. We reached the mid/late game and Hayley crushed R&amp;D with Stargate runs, trashing nasty events and agendas. We knew 4 pts were already in Archives and the score was 6:2 in my favour. For two turns I IA\u2019d in the remote, but Aspen still pressured R&amp;D, protected by a single Raven that he could break with bad pub. The first card was NGO, the second was game-winning Armed Intimidation. Before I scored out, in the most unfortunate turn of events my opponent did the Stargate run last click and couldn\u2019t go back for the agenda he saw.

I want to congratulate Matuszczak for becoming Polish Champion, after becoming 2nd twice as far as I know!<br />\nI was not sure what to play, but I was in the need of a new runner. So I decided to try out Val, as she is always good and is able to play Film Critic.<br />\nI decided to give <a href=\"/en/card/26072\">Mystic Maemi</a> a try, the card is good and I want to see it early so my draw was going to be event based. <a href=\"/en/card/11008\">Deuces Wild</a> is a totally different card, when you can use it for 0 or 1 credit! As often it means gaining 3 creds &amp; 2 cards for 1 click, isn't that bonkers? And of course complimented by <a href=\"/en/card/07032\">I've Had Worse</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/06073\">Inject</a>. Also Deuces can be used to: remove tags after stealing an Agenda from Argus as it usually loads <a href=\"/en/card/26072\">Mystic Maemi</a> or to load <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>.<br />\nAll these horrible 5/3 agendas, I wanted to try <a href=\"/en/card/08086\">Film Critic</a> so badly as there are so many punisher cards and of course Punitive. It's kind of a nonbo with <a href=\"/en/card/08043\">Turntable</a> but usually also with <a href=\"/en/card/26072\">Mystic Maemi</a> you want to steal the agenda and maybe swap it and it's mainly for the punisher cards like SDS, SSL, Obokata (or Obokata when you are &lt; 4 cards), Bacterial, City Works and of course the decks that base their kill on this.</p>\n\n<h1>Games</h1>\n\n<h1>Game 1: Matuszczak</h1>\n\n<p>AgInfusion, not the matchup I like due to their boops, on the other hand <a href=\"/en/card/21103\">Hippo</a> can do something and <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a> too. He was on a Jinja version and able to score a Nisei (0 - 2). I got <a href=\"/en/card/08043\">Turntable</a> and was able to swap a Philotic against his Nisei (2 - 2). He got to score a second Nisei as I was not able to contest his double Excal remote (none rezzed) with Aumakua on 0 counters (2 - 4). Loaded Aumakua to contest the remote. And found an SSL. Do I swap it against the other Nisei? My decision was \"No\", maybe questionable (5 - 4). He was preparing for a purge, although his R&amp;D was only protected by 2 Cortex Lock, which did max. 1 damage, but still. So I decided to unload my <a href=\"/en/card/10085\">The Turning Wheel</a> to either hopefully score and win, or force him to use his Nisei counter. He didn't and I was able to find another SSL for the win.<br />\nThe best feeling was, when he got his SSL credits and I had 3 <a href=\"/en/card/21106\">PAD Tap</a>!<br />\n1 - 0</p>\n\n<h1>Game 2: Ojciec</h1>\n\n<p>6 Agenda Azmari. He tried to rush out his points. Scored an SSL (0 - 3), tried to score the next one. I was going to HQ, find an Agenda (3 - 3) and Stimhacked his remote to pay throug 3 Slotmachines with the 9 creds to steal Degree Mill (6 - 3). He HHN me and I had to go Tag me. He got a Degree Mill out. I assumed a Border Control, so I went: Install <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a>, Run Archives, run Remote, but it was an Enigma, but I would not have been able to steal it anyway.... with only 1 installed card (6 - 6).\nTime finished the game. Draw.\n1 - 0 - 1</p>\n\n<h1>Game 3: murass</h1>\n\n<p>Argus, I was not able to find my money cards and draw was an issue. So I tried the best but he got to 6 points. When drawing I was able to get into HQ 3 times, unloading my <a href=\"/en/card/10085\">The Turning Wheel</a> missing the last Hostile for his win.\n1 - 1 - 1</p>\n\n<h1>Game 4: Boreira</h1>\n\n<p>The second Azmari of the tournament... I got them all. Assumed he would play either kill or Exchange. So when I had the chance to <a href=\"/en/card/10083\">Rebirth</a> I was going for <a href=\"/en/card/07028\">Edward Kim: Humanity's Hammer</a> to kill his pieces as often I can't stay untagged. That was a good decision, killed 2 Boom and other stuff and was able to find 3 Agendas. Breaking News Hound for 1 credit felt amazing!\n2 - 1 - 1</p>\n\n<h1>Game 5: Ratkin</h1>\n\n<p>Asa, hopefully no assett spam. I got bold, running R&amp;D he rezzed Ichi while I had 0 programs and a trace while I'm on 15 creds seems unwise. I saw an Icewall and went hm.... what is this? Having played kill out of HB and seeing the strange deck, I got an idea and rebirthed again into Kim, to kill primarily his Load Testings and Hard Hitting News. And it was correct, I was playing against \"my <a href=\"../57317/murder-mirror-col-worlds-2019-\">Murder Mirror</a>\" deck, just out of Asa and some changes.<br />\nHe was able to Hard Hitting me, but paying 8 was totally ok. I was playing careful, Stimhacked his MCA Authority. To stay high enough and hippod his HQ to load Aumakua and kill his combo pieces. It would have taken some time, but to land the kill was kind of impossible for him and his weak ICE.\n3 - 1 -1</p>\n\n<p>I was very satisfied, not having played Val for ages like many others. I was kind of lucky sometimes, for sure!</p>\n\n<p>Would have loved to have <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a>, but with only 1 <a href=\"/en/card/08043\">Turntable</a> it was to risky for me in terms of having the MU.

I thought I'd write something up for ABR publishing purposes.  I changed the name since it felt weird naming the deck after his girlfriend =P</p>\n\n<p>Originally, after World's, I was looking for cool decks, and was instantly in love with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57215/swiss-cheese-is-yellow-3rd-in-swiss-14th-after-cut-\">Wet Toastie's deck</a>, and thought \"This could easily be brought into Weyland, using Armed Intimidation as a kill condition,\" and set out to create a deck.  I had something more or less workable that I was trying out in Gagarin and in Argus, seeing which might be the better fit, when the next day @Cliquil posted his Jemison list that got 24th at Worlds, which I had been itching to see anyhow.  Lo and behold, it was incredibly close to what I was trying to do, but in Jemison.  Jemison, I realized, makes a ton of sense, since you can rez things like Oberth to get free advancements for instant murder.</p>\n\n<p>The main changes I made were to take out Stadoff #3 and a Malia, and add in a Neural (since his deck had 1 floating influence) and a Consulting Visit.  Neural can be used to make the 5 meat damage choice on Armed Intimidation lethal even with a 5 card hand.  In my testing with my version of this, I found Consulting Visit very good at getting Mushin when one just can't be drawn, as well as fetch Neural and the occasional BOOM!</p>\n\n<p>The only game I lost was to Obol when his Smoke deck played a Guru Davinder on the field.  I couldn't find any way to play a Mushin for a Junebug, otherwise I think I still could have won this, but when he dropped the Guru he just started going from left to right checking all my remotes.  My rightmost remote was Malia, and if I had been able to get out a Junebug, I could have rezzed it to blank Guru and murdered him regardless, but it wasn't meant to be.  Finally my remotes were Psychic Field, Reconstruction Contract, and Malia.  He had 2 clicks left and checked the Psychic Field, and I realized my only out was to try and score, so I needed the RecoCo to score an Armed Intimidation from hand next turn, so I rezzed Malia to make him eat the net damage, forcing him to draw (he had seen the Neural in my hand).  After this it was a slow defeat, as I couldn't do much to win.</p>\n", "user_id": 7972, "user_name": "Saan", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 3, "10094": 1, "11058": 3, "11097": 3, "12016": 1, "12017": 1, "12018": 3, "12077": 2, "12098": 1, "21020": 2, "21057": 3, "21069": 1, "21078": 3, "25089": 3, "25101": 1, "25124": 3, "25126": 1, "25130": 2, "25135": 3, "25146": 3, "26058": 1, "05010": 3, "05015": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57488": {"id": 57488, "date_creation": "2019-10-21T12:13:16+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-21T22:24:42+00:00", "name": "Reading Rainbow - 5th at Polish Nats", "description": "<p>When deciding what deck to bring to the nationals in Poland, I new I was bringing Shaper, because I just didn't have any time to practice anything else between Worlds and this event.  I played Hayley at Worlds, but I've played a lot of Smoke in the past and thought it would be an okay meta call.  It's only okay vs Asa, but is generally good vs Glacier, and I've found it's usually fine vs Weyland decks.</p>\n\n<p>There's a lot of versions of Smoke floating around, but I always liked Timmy Wong's <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/51013/the-reader\">The Reader</a>, which he played at US Nationals in 2018, mainly because of the Falsified Credentials allowing you to run after you've already checked to see if it's an agenda or just an NGO in the remote.  Palana was the deck to beat at US Nats 2018, so I figured this is probably a safe place to start, seeing as Palana and AgInfusion are some of the better decks right now.</p>\n\n<p>When playing Smoke in general right now, especially vs Palana, I felt like Peace in Our Time might be hurting me more than helping me set up, as the games I lost I always felt like the Corp would be nowhere near as far ahead if they didn't have 15 free credits to help them along.  Also, looking at the Smoke decks that did well at Worlds this year, I saw that the one that did the best was @ryanbantwins' deck.  He purported that it was because his deck ran Dorm Computer over Film Critic, but the real big difference that I saw with bis deck vs the other Smoke decks was that he wasn't running Peace in Our Time, he was running 3 Deuces instead.  Instead of trying to accelerate the deck through economy, like Peace does, he chose to accelerate by making the deck draw more cards, which I think is a great idea, seeing as people see Smoke as kind of a slower deck.</p>\n\n<p>So I kinda took Timmy's deck, took Ryan's deck, and threw them in a blender.  This is where I ended up!  I added a Ghost Runner over Net Mercur #3 to give it more potential aggression, since Net Mercur is kinda slow, and I decided rather than the Build Script that Ryan was running, I'd do a Stimhack, since sometimes you actually want real money for a run.  I also really did want to play Film Critic rather than Dorm Computer because this deck really can't economically contest Punitive Counterstrike, and can get hung up trying to steal Obakata behind Data Loops or a Kakugo that they make you run multiple times through on the remote.</p>\n", "user_id": 7972, "user_name": "Saan", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11008": 3, "11030": 1, "11046": 2, "11066": 1, "11085": 1, "21064": 2, "25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25042": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 2, "26009": 1, "26021": 3, "26025": 2, "03038": 2, "03041": 1, "03046": 2, "03053": 3, "06040": 1, "06057": 1, "06077": 1, "06079": 2, "08086": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57489": {"id": 57489, "date_creation": "2019-10-21T13:49:21+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-21T15:07:15+00:00", "name": "GNK Middelkerke - Titan", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14355, "user_name": "M0H4WK", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"20071": 1, "20073": 3, "20078": 3, "20079": 3, "20083": 1, "20084": 1, "20085": 3, "20086": 1, "20087": 3, "20088": 3, "20089": 3, "20090": 3, "20091": 3, "20092": 3, "20107": 3, "20125": 3, "20126": 1, "20129": 3, "20130": 1, "20132": 3, "25118": 1, "07003": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57490": {"id": 57490, "date_creation": "2019-10-21T13:49:22+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-21T15:07:12+00:00", "name": "GNK Middelkerke -  Ayla", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14355, "user_name": "M0H4WK", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"13012": 1, "20005": 2, "20015": 1, "20016": 2, "20028": 1, "20031": 1, "20038": 3, "20039": 2, "20040": 3, "20041": 2, "20043": 2, "20044": 1, "20045": 2, "20048": 1, "20049": 1, "20050": 2, "20051": 1, "20054": 3, "20055": 1, "20056": 3, "20057": 3, "20058": 2, "20059": 3, "20060": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57491": {"id": 57491, "date_creation": "2019-10-21T13:53:50+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-21T13:53:50+00:00", "name": "Worlds - Sportz'ing [Ayyliens]", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14355, "user_name": "M0H4WK", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"21017": 3, "22026": 1, "22027": 3, "22029": 2, "22031": 3, "22032": 3, "22049": 2, "25068": 3, "25079": 2, "25146": 3, "26037": 3, "27004": 3, "03004": 1, "06001": 3, "06010": 3, "06049": 1, "06061": 2, "06081": 3, "08110": 3, "08120": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57492": {"id": 57492, "date_creation": "2019-10-21T15:39:34+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-17T21:14:26+00:00", "name": "Jinja Abuse 2.0 (Undefeated @ King of Servers)", "description": "<p>A refined version of the <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55626/jinja-abuse-1st-undefeated-nisei-online-standard-\">Sports deck</a> from the Nisei online tournament that went 5-0 in the King of Servers tournament.

When you fear HPT or BOOM!, use them, when not, just throw away without second look. With Liza draw you can afford 4 dead cards in non-kill matchups.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Eater</strong> - it can be used to: fire Liza ability, pump up the Turtle, fire Paragon, collect money on Bankrolls, run with Stargate, run with Embezzle, run with Diversion of Funds, run with Dirty Laundry, also it allows to run into almost any ICE without fear (except for Swordsman, but who plays this card?). Along Stargate this is the BEST card in the whole deck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Embezzle</strong> - except of being awesome card on its own, it also helps with sniping HHN and HPT when played with killy corps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stargate</strong> - everybody knows that this card is bonkers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SMC</strong> - allows to get Turtle, Eater, Stargate or Bukhgalter, depending on the situation. Better than Special Order because it works for every program, not only Icebreakers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bukhgalter</strong> - best killer in the game, useful in some situations (mainly Anansi, Tour Guide and Swordsman - if someone will actually play it).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Flip Switch</strong> - with this beautiful card you can run like a madman even with empty Turtle. Also helps with tag removal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hot Pursuit</strong> - I didn't want to include this card because it would be dead when played against killy corps.

Then a couple of bigger meanies to put in a scoring remote, <a href=\"/en/card/22046\">Hydra</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/12095\">Data Loop</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/01090\">Tollbooth</a>. The main choices I made for ICE was <a href=\"/en/card/09013\">Archangel</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/11013\">Chrysalis</a>. I wanted ICE that was worth the Runner accessing in R&amp;D or HQ, at least in surprise so that maybe they didn't have them figured in their pre-run math. The influence for <a href=\"/en/card/11013\">Chrysalis</a> was cheap enough for me to add it.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"icon icon-subroutine\"></span>Upgrades<br /><a href=\"/en/card/08115\">Product Placement</a> is there just for the money and to maybe tax them some to trash it. The real winner of the deck is <a href=\"/en/card/21096\">Mwanza City Grid</a>. This card works the best in <a href=\"/en/card/08092\">Haarpsichord Studios: Entertainment Unleashed</a>. They access 4 cards minimum, maybe score 1 Agenda and set off it's effect and just get to look at the rest of the Agendas they can't have but because of the way I built the deck they will probly' run into some ambushes and help me out.

But the people (one person on Slack) have demanded (briefly mentioned one of the cards in this list, completely out of context) to see it, so who am I argue?</p>\n\n<p>Following the success of last year's <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/52208/lady-gaga-rin\">Lady Gaga-rin</a>, giving Team Believe It or Not This Planned Almost Worked Once its name no less, I continued to look for ways to 'prove' that Gagarin can be a fun ID to face sometimes. It was difficult to judge based on the bewildered faces of my opponents, but I think they were happy tears. Reading cards is always fun, right?</p>\n\n<p>The idea of this deck to earn as many credits as possible for friendly japes like HHN and Punitive, while assembling a ridiculous rig as cheaply as possible. There was some debate about the 'cheapest' way to rez an IUSE and a Mumba Temple (I think it's the same either way), but once you've got the next one rolling you're in for a pretty sweet time. Three Mumba Temples lets you rez The Root FOR FREE. That's a six credit saving, unbelievable. With IUSEs in play, rezzing Dedicated Technician Team and Khondi Plaza actually gains you credits. As does Levy University, which you can then use to tutor some ridiculous ice, before installing it FOR FREE, and, assuming the runner doesn't trash all your stuff, rez FOR FREE. Then when you get an agenda in there, guess how much it is to advance stuff with The Root credits? That's right! And once you score that one off, ridiculous TeamSpo, that would have been better as pretty much any other card, let's you recur stuff FOR FREE too. No wonder I'm not sleeping, this deck is just too exciting.</p>\n\n<p>On the day it went 3-2, with wins over very sensible decks like 419, Freedom and Leela. It only just lost to a second Freedom, which is obviously not a great match up, with a surprise rez of an unbreakable Next Diamond (four influence well spent) during a Stimhack run, but alas Russell had three cards in hand to just avoid death. And then its luck ran out completely against Smoke who annoyingly didn't care how big my ice was.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway for next year is obviously that I need more Brain Damage in the deck, and not to play against Smoke as much.</p>\n\n<p>But regardless, another fantastic team tournament. Can't wait to see what's possible next year. Make Gagarin Fun Again!</p>\n", "user_id": 22234, "user_name": "mcg", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10018": 3, "10054": 3, "10073": 2, "11016": 2, "11080": 2, "11112": 2, "12019": 2, "12098": 1, "21038": 3, "21060": 1, "21080": 3, "21112": 1, "21119": 2, "22052": 2, "25108": 2, "25138": 3, "26056": 3, "03024": 1, "06008": 1, "06028": 2, "06071": 1, "07002": 1, "07013": 1, "07026": 2, "08110": 1, "08118": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57449": {"id": 57449, "date_creation": "2019-10-18T13:21:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-18T13:21:42+00:00", "name": "CtM Eternity", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 5521, "user_name": "JackMade", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10053": 3, "10054": 3, "10092": 1, "10094": 1, "11016": 3, "11017": 1, "11094": 3, "25107": 3, "25115": 1, "25117": 1, "25118": 1, "25139": 2, "25143": 1, "25146": 3, "28004": 3, "01081": 1, "01082": 3, "01092": 3, "04015": 3, "04076": 3, "06088": 1, "09015": 3, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57450": {"id": 57450, "date_creation": "2019-10-18T13:21:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-18T13:21:42+00:00", "name": "Andy Eternity", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 5521, "user_name": "JackMade", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10083": 1, "10085": 2, "12104": 1, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "25010": 1, "25011": 2, "25022": 3, "25030": 2, "25036": 1, "25037": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "28002": 3, "01012": 2, "01014": 1, "01018": 3, "01024": 3, "02083": 1, "05048": 1, "09053": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57451": {"id": 57451, "date_creation": "2019-10-18T13:47:02+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-01T23:32:20+00:00", "name": "Apocval with Shard (26th at worlds)", "description": "<p>Deck stole straight from Uraken (maybe we should build for each other :think:)\nhttps://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55891/-stargate-the-apoc-list-peter-dinya-beat-in-top-cut</p>\n\n<p>Deck performed very well, went 6-3.</p>\n\n<p>Gameplan is not complicated, play DDos, run HQ and install utopia shard, and pop Utopia shard on 3rd click on archives. </p>\n\n<p>7th game:\nTurn Im about to apoc i run HQ and steals a Goverment takeover, my reaction:\n<img data-src=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/475/Screen_Shot_2018-10-25_at_11.02.15_AM.png\" alt=\"pika\" />\n(After 10 min I play a wanton with 2 clicks remaning and manage to hit the Punitive and win some turns later)</p>\n", "user_id": 23133, "user_name": "Cambro", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10083": 1, "11008": 1, "11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11081": 3, "25005": 1, "25007": 2, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "26004": 2, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "06100": 1, "07030": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 2, "08021": 3, "08043": 1, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.2"}, "57452": {"id": 57452, "date_creation": "2019-10-18T13:47:31+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-01T23:24:21+00:00", "name": "Hey listen - Navi (26th at worlds)", "description": "<p>This deck went 4-2-1 at worlds (only played 7 games due to 241 two times).\nMain plan is not that hard, rush against anything.

So besides <a href=\"/en/card/13040\">Mason Bellamy</a> which is causing apoc headache, I wanted to add <a href=\"/en/card/06048\">Crisium Grid</a> to be a bit more resilient until <a href=\"/en/card/21031\">Jinja City Grid</a> destroys any approach so DDoS is nothing to consider anymore.<br />\nSo I slotted 1 Crisum by removing 1 <a href=\"/en/card/21118\">Surveyor</a> as too often it's the first ICE I draw and I need to put it on a central. So 1 inf for Crisium and the  spare inf could be used for <a href=\"/en/card/26063\">Vulnerability Audit</a> as you can install advance it for the win and you are not trying to score any agenda in one turn anyway. Removing 1 <a href=\"/en/card/06001\">Domestic Sleepers</a> was a tall ask and I kind of regreted it the whole day as I was never able to score out with it. Slotted <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a> as it has synergies with <a href=\"/en/card/23054\">Border Control</a> and might also help against Crim, when they DoF you click 1 &amp; 2.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea is the same, install <a href=\"/en/card/21031\">Jinja City Grid</a> play your draw <a href=\"/en/card/21080\">Rashida Jaheem</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/11111\">Violet Level Clearance</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/04090\">Blue Level Clearance</a> and create Servers of doom and make money. Score an <a href=\"/en/card/21038\">SSL Endorsement</a> early or let them steal it and us your ability to get money or draw, what ever you need more.</p>\n\n<p>The deck went 3 - 3 during the day, losing the first 3 matches, winning the next 3 and not being played in a 241.<br />\nBut <a href=\"/en/card/26063\">Vulnerability Audit</a> pulled it's weigth and gave me an unexpected win and some legs in other games. So maybe it's worth to try it as a 3x? But dropping <a href=\"/en/card/21010\">Ikawah Project</a> seems not like a good idea.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 1 against Joss on 419 (0 - 1)</h2>\n\n<p>My deck betrayed me. Not finding Jinja or ICE, only Econ so 419 had a lot of time to setup and stomb me sooner or later. It was still closer then I thought at the start and playing Joss was a nice start into the day.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 2 against fgcsem4n on Hayley (0 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>I was not able to keep her out of my Servers and things went down pretty fast and mainly I was not fast enough.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 3 against Dethvir on Smoke (0 - 3)</h2>\n\n<p>Can't remember that game, but Smoke wrecked me.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 4 against Airin on Ken (1 - 3)</h2>\n\n<p>When Ken can't run anymore he is unhappy, that happens sooner or later against a Glacier with Jinja. So after a strong start I was able to keep Ken out and got the win.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 5 against Ardu on 419 (2 - 3)</h2>\n\n<p>This time things came together in a good way and I was able to fire out of all Servers.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 6 against Counter0 on Leela (3 - 3)</h2>\n\n<p>I ICEed HQ with Jinja 1st so that DoF is not a thing anymore and they discarded theiy DoF sooner or later. Surviving the first 2 scores I was sure I would be able to close the game.</p>\n", "user_id": 18163, "user_name": "5N00P1", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11049": 3, "11111": 3, "12029": 3, "21010": 2, "21031": 3, "21038": 3, "21039": 2, "21080": 3, "21118": 2, "22026": 1, "22029": 3, "23054": 3, "25068": 1, "25082": 2, "25083": 1, "25139": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26037": 2, "26063": 1, "06001": 1, "06061": 3, "06111": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57433": {"id": 57433, "date_creation": "2019-10-14T12:01:55+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-16T19:31:10+00:00", "name": "Bad Meta Dash (#113 Worlds 2019)", "description": "<p>This is a failed meta call for Worlds 2019 (which was still good enough for my taste together with this <a href=\"../57432/damon-abuse-3-0-113-worlds-2019-\">Sportsmetal</a>, but it still managed to pull it's weight. I thought about what are my bad matchups and only Argus came into mind and I hoped to dodge the matchup as most Outfits play Punitive and not the HPT kill anymore.<br />\nWhat I missed was:  </p>\n\n<ul><li>Palana is a bad matchup as it plays Kakugo and you don't want to lose a card per turn. And you drawing gives them money and you are very much on the denial plan. So making Palana poor is not that easy and running every turn into centrals as well.</li>\n<li>Many people still play kill in Outfit.</li>\n</ul><p>During the day I met:\n2x Outfit, 2x Palana, 1x Blue Sun, 1x Replicating Perfection, 1x Argus, 1x \nAll of them kind of bad...</p>\n\n<p>The deck went 4 - 3 during the day </p>\n\n<h2>Game 1 Joss on Outfit (0 - 1)</h2>\n\n<p>Run HQ, rez Raven, see HHN, run R&amp;D see HPT with 4 tags. Run HQ twice, gg.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 2 fgcsem4n on Palana (0 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>Have the <a href=\"/en/card/03048\">Inti</a> in hand and think, don't run into Anansi install it first. What happened, lost it when running click 1 into Anansi on R&amp;D. Which made me draw a lot to find <a href=\"/en/card/22012\">Tycoon</a> and giving him scoring windows. Femmed the Border Control in 2 ICEd remote, also bad.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 3 Dethvir on Replicating Perfection (1 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>They want to ICE their centrals, I want to run them.... Tourguide on HQ and a lot of assets.... I think I ran HQ twice the whole game? I managed to get to 4 points, while they where on 6. Bad bad. Their board was impressive, but I had a <a href=\"/en/card/12008\">Mad Dash</a> in hand + <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a>, but with a Nisei on the other side? Shit. I <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a> R&amp;D, trash a Medical Breakthrough and Liza draws me a 2nd Mad Dash, so I <a href=\"/en/card/12008\">Mad Dash</a>ed twice into Archives for the win.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 4 Irene on Palana (2 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>Why again? Where are my easy matchups?<br />\nI was lucky here, DoF them, EShutdown them, keep there credits low and steal some agendas for the win.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 5 Ardu on Outfit (3 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>He only played 1 HPT without finding it. I was lucky hear, easiest matchup of the day.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 6 Countzer0 on BlueSun (4 - 2)</h2>\n\n<p>Shit was I scared! Oversight early or Buildings Block can really kill me &amp; keep me out. I was so lucky &amp; dumb. Got my Stargate, was able to make him rez Trebuchet. Play <a href=\"/en/card/02043\">Emergency Shutdown</a> afterwards, he was so frustrated. But I missed to steal a Hostile on R&amp;D when I knew it was coming, bad play! When I was on 6 points, 4 bad pub, 85 creds, Aumakua &amp; Datasucker really strong he conceded. I <a href=\"/en/card/21084\">Embezzle</a> him 3 times for ICE, so he could not get his nasty pieces out. Femmed his Chiayshi &amp; when he rezzed it also played shutdown.<br />\nI was lucky here, as I could deny his econ for a long time, him clicking for credits.</p>\n\n<h2>Game 7 AxWill on Argus (4 - 3)</h2>\n\n<p>This was a 241 and I played his Argus. Stole a hostile turn 1. Stargated another one + Mad Dash. Atlas was going into his hand, but he had HPT in hand for the kill, that  I never saw. Could have <a href=\"/en/card/21084\">Embezzle</a> it, but not without seeing it.\nSo I died gloriously against Argus, almost on 5 points.</p>\n\n<p>That ended my journey. I was so close to day 2, although it was so unlikely.</p>\n", "user_id": 18163, "user_name": "5N00P1", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"12008": 2, "12101": 3, "12104": 3, "21023": 3, "21065": 3, "21084": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "22008": 1, "22009": 3, "22010": 3, "22011": 3, "22012": 1, "25011": 2, "25024": 3, "25030": 2, "25036": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 2, "03048": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57434": {"id": 57434, "date_creation": "2019-10-14T18:57:39+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-14T18:57:39+00:00", "name": "PYLDS - Push Your Luck Delivery System V1.0 (2-3 at CoL)", "description": "<p>This is the Push Your Deck I used at the Crown of Lasers during Worlds 2019.

It was by far the weaker of my two decks but still helped me to get an excellent 30th place. The deck turned out to be a bit of a jack of all trades but a master of none. Having all the tools in the 45 cards but often not having the ability to turn that into a win. It is defiantly some of the losses were down to piloting error but the decks tempo often felt off which it had felt in practice and I was unable to correct before Worlds. As this deck is a home build and a progression of trying to do different things with Hayley I don\u2019t think it any stronger than the deck I took to Euros where I came 17th and may be in fact weaker. That said as of writing I have not decided if it is time to retire Nanny Plum or if she will ride one last time into Sheffield for UK Nationals.\u00a0</p>\n", "user_id": 26668, "user_name": "craigmurtagh", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10045": 1, "10085": 1, "11030": 1, "11085": 1, "12088": 1, "22020": 1, "25007": 2, "25010": 1, "25027": 1, "25048": 2, "25054": 1, "25056": 3, "25058": 3, "25059": 3, "26004": 1, "26025": 1, "26026": 2, "03038": 3, "03045": 2, "03046": 3, "03053": 3, "03054": 2, "06019": 1, "06037": 3, "06079": 1, "08001": 1, "08025": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.2"}, "57376": {"id": 57376, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T07:08:29+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-30T08:15:21+00:00", "name": "Wise Old Elf V2 30th at worlds won 8 lost 1", "description": "<p>First there are a few thank you before I go into the V2.

Unfortunately it was let down by my runner a bit but still leading me to an excellent 30th place. The deck is a home build and is a progression of a Argus build I have been playing. The deck was designed to win by gear checking, fast advancing or kills but the Surveyor also allowed a taxing win conditions against MK Ultra. The big advantage of the deck I think is that it is so hard to judge the correct way to play against it if you are too defensive and let me score an Atlas with 2 tokens you are way behind if you run too early and too poor you could have 4 tags and be way behind.\u00a0 If I am scoring behind a single Surveyor the remote needs to be challenged while if I am scoring behind a Guard you need to find your breaker. All this I think leads to some very interesting and close games which I was lucky to be on the winning side of.</p>\n", "user_id": 26668, "user_name": "craigmurtagh", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11016": 3, "11097": 2, "12058": 3, "21036": 2, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "21119": 2, "22056": 3, "23054": 3, "25079": 1, "25124": 3, "25125": 1, "25126": 3, "25133": 3, "25146": 3, "26037": 3, "26058": 1, "26059": 1, "05024": 1, "05027": 1, "07003": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57377": {"id": 57377, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T08:10:14+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-17T17:14:19+00:00", "name": "EArgus - We protect your digital Rights! 52nd @Worlds (5-1),", "description": "<p>Just another Argus from the Worlds.

Wasn't feeling the Brahman Hayley enough on Friday so I decided to follow the path of Apocalypse. On Friday I discussed with Ola who said Apoc should be played out of Alice instead of Valencia, as you will then pressure all the centrals from round 1.</p>\n\n<p>Cue few hours later and we are walking the stairs up to our apartment while Artturi points out, that Omar could be worth a try. Our reasoning went something like this:</p>\n\n<ol><li>As with Alice, you will pressure all the centrals from round 1.</li>\n<li>On top of that, it makes the corp spread their ice thinner or gives you easier time to pull of Apoc, in best case both.</li>\n<li>Compared to Valencia, you don't have to find your rebirth, you start with it.</li>\n<li>There are five cards and three influence, that practically only help you draw through said five cards and rebirth into Omar.</li>\n</ol><p>And yes, the deck felt like super-brightly burning apoc-anarch. You can pressure all the centrals and have apoc ready few turns earlier. If corp spends time double-icing centrals, you can then pressure remotes instead. But as with all the brightest-burning stars, this deck will also burn out sooner than other Apocs, so you definitely have to start building the first apoc and pressure right away.</p>\n\n<p>Many opponents were prepared for Apoc, so this might not have been the best meta-call, but I was still happy to play the deck. Went 3-5 overall, so my corp definitely carried me. There were only two Omars at the worlds, but I take all the claims I can get. :P</p>\n\n<p>Card cuts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>We took this <a href=\"/en/deck/55891\">Apoc Val</a> as starting point and cut <a href=\"/en/card/06120\">Earthrise</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/11008\">Deuces Wild</a> (which help you draw through the five extra cards), <a href=\"/en/card/08023\">Career Fair</a> (which gives you money to play said Earthrise), <a href=\"/en/card/10083\">Rebirth</a> (you start where you want to end up) and <a href=\"/en/card/02101\">Retrieval Run</a> (people ice archives against Omar so that is likely to be of little value).</li>\n</ul><p>Card choices:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Most of the Apoc shell is fixed: draw, money, breakers, apocs, ddos.</li>\n<li>What you can change is the pressure and finisher cards. I think <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a> is the correct choice for post-apocalyptic pressure.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/08043\">Turntable</a> did not do anything for me. I could see it giving huge value, but that will be first one I will try to change.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/06100\">Utopia Shard</a> numbers could be toyed around. Probably would change turntable into wanton or stimhack.</li>\n</ul><p>On Apoc decks in general:</p>\n\n<ul><li>This felt good, I think Omar is a good option if you want to go Apoc route, you just have to play really fast and pressure early (ie. lean into decks strengths). Would love to hear arguments for Valencia and Alice, as based on my un-success, I can't say conclusively that Omar is the right choice. Valencia does get some more money so she can play longer game than Omar but in most games, I missed out on something between 3-7 credits and usually you would love to pay that kind of money to get apoc round or two earlier from Valencia.</li>\n</ul><p>Tournament report:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>R1: Loss. Argus on three Armed Intimidation. Did not see that one coming and died. I guessed correctly there would probably be winning agenda in Archives, but as it could have been Hostile, decided I have time to check the bin later. So that one was piloting error + better play from my opponent.</p></li>\n<li><p>R2: Win. Regular Argus. When your opponent does not have lot of ice, gives you bad pub and you have anarch money plus tools to pressure all the board, you tend to pressure a lot.</p></li>\n<li><p>R3: Loss. Ig.

This one went more like typical Argus game.</p></li>\n<li><p>R7: Corp-win, 241.</p></li>\n<li><p>R8: Win. CtM 241. Apoc and Hacktivist put a good pressure on CtM. Still this was nail-biter to the end and felt like those intense Anarch-CtM -matches from last worlds stream. One of the best Netrunner games I've ever played.</p></li>\n<li><p>R9: Loss. Asa 241. Faceplanted into Pinsels Asa. Had great money and draw in starter hand, but after that got no Apocs, Paperclips or other important tools. Got one apoc in, but at least 3 rounds too late and you can guess what happened after that. And Combo Asa + Pinsel is so strong combination, I could have easily lost even with nuts draw.</p></li>\n</ul><p>So, all in all, the deck pulled 3-5. Had great time with it, some matches could have gone better with better pilot or draw (or not, my opponents played really well), but more likely should have played Khumalo or Pelangi-Hayley instead.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all the Nisei people for arranging the tournament and all the great people I got chance to meet and play against! This is so great game with so great people, I'm so happy I got a chance to be part of the weekend.</p>\n", "user_id": 30844, "user_name": "AxWill", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11043": 1, "11081": 3, "25007": 2, "25017": 3, "25022": 2, "25059": 3, "25063": 2, "26004": 2, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "06100": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 2, "08021": 3, "08043": 1, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57379": {"id": 57379, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:27:35+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T10:27:35+00:00", "name": "Choo Choo forever, you magnificent bastard!", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 9511, "user_name": "manveruppd", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10018": 2, "10053": 3, "10067": 2, "10092": 1, "11094": 2, "25072": 2, "25080": 3, "25107": 3, "25114": 1, "25115": 1, "25116": 2, "25120": 1, "25146": 3, "26047": 3, "01081": 1, "01082": 2, "01092": 2, "04015": 3, "04034": 1, "04076": 3, "06005": 1, "07027": 1, "08057": 1, "08110": 2, "09004": 1, "09013": 1, "09018": 1, "09026": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57380": {"id": 57380, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:27:35+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T10:27:35+00:00", "name": "Ewiger Geist", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 9511, "user_name": "manveruppd", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10023": 3, "10042": 5, "10064": 3, "10085": 2, "11082": 1, "12008": 1, "12104": 3, "13011": 1, "13025": 2, "22014": 1, "22025": 1, "25027": 1, "25033": 1, "25034": 1, "26013": 1, "26015": 1, "26016": 1, "01018": 2, "02065": 1, "03035": 2, "03054": 3, "04106": 3, "08022": 2, "08062": 3, "08063": 1, "08086": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57381": {"id": 57381, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:32:00+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T10:32:00+00:00", "name": "Sparkling Core v1", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 18500, "user_name": "iref", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"25070": 1, "25072": 2, "25073": 2, "25080": 1, "25082": 2, "25105": 1, "25106": 2, "25107": 3, "25108": 2, "25109": 1, "25111": 1, "25112": 2, "25114": 3, "25115": 2, "25116": 1, "25117": 1, "25119": 2, "25120": 2, "25121": 2, "25139": 1, "25140": 2, "25141": 2, "25142": 3, "25143": 3, "25144": 2, "25145": 1, "25146": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57382": {"id": 57382, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:32:01+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T10:32:01+00:00", "name": "Core set Gabe", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 18500, "user_name": "iref", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25011": 2, "25015": 2, "25017": 2, "25020": 1, "25023": 2, "25024": 1, "25026": 2, "25027": 2, "25029": 1, "25030": 2, "25031": 1, "25032": 2, "25033": 3, "25034": 2, "25035": 2, "25037": 2, "25038": 2, "25046": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 2, "25062": 2, "25063": 2, "25065": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57383": {"id": 57383, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:33:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-09T12:41:14+00:00", "name": "Sportsmetal", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 18500, "user_name": "iref", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10037": 3, "11049": 3, "11060": 3, "11080": 1, "21031": 3, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "22026": 1, "22029": 3, "23054": 3, "25068": 3, "25073": 3, "25080": 1, "25082": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "06061": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57384": {"id": 57384, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:33:42+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T12:27:07+00:00", "name": "Good Stuff Freedom v5 - Pelangi", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 18500, "user_name": "iref", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11008": 2, "11042": 2, "11081": 2, "21002": 3, "21042": 1, "21081": 1, "21103": 3, "21106": 3, "25007": 3, "25010": 1, "25011": 1, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25065": 1, "26025": 1, "03038": 2, "06033": 2, "06073": 3, "07032": 3, "08021": 2, "08043": 1, "08086": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57385": {"id": 57385, "date_creation": "2019-10-12T10:54:44+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T23:41:12+00:00", "name": "let'SS gO!

I could always tell when an RND access showed one of those two cards because the runner would say \"O .... K ....\".  :)</p>\n\n<p>The scoring plan here is mostly to not score.  Get a credit lead, feed them points and then murder them.  They need 4 agendas stolen to win, but you only need 1 GFI to be stolen to murder them.  If you need to score, take advantage of the windows you have, because they will probably close quickly.  <a href=\"/en/card/02051\">Project Vitruvius</a> counters could also mean the difference between a win and a loss.</p>\n\n<p>I had a couple of games where I scored out, but mostly I murdered runners, often quickly.  Round 1 at Crown of Lasers was against a Gnat deck.  That was a flatline on Turn 3, Click 1.  :)  In other games, a <a href=\"/en/card/02051\">Project Vitruvius</a> with a token was the MVP.  I murdered runners with single, double and triple <a href=\"/en/card/25138\">Punitive Counterstrike</a>s.

I had a blast playing with you both and I'm super happy with how we did at the tournament (9th of 63 teams!!!!).</p>\n\n<p>This was my pet deck throughout the summer and had some misguided detours (Hello, <a href=\"/en/card/27002\">Swift</a>!).  <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/2001/spags\">@spags</a>, @tokaru and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/2170/aandries\">@aandries</a> helped me refine it and @spags encouraged me to just drop the <a href=\"/en/card/03035\">Levy AR Lab Access</a> that I was leaning on before the latest MWL and to just go fast.  That was a good call and playing fast kept things fun and exciting.</p>\n\n<p>The plan here is pretty simple - money up, get a minimal rig to land the <a href=\"/en/card/09030\">Apocalypse</a> and go to town.  <a href=\"/en/card/10080\">Out of the Ashes</a> does most of the work here.  It is a lot of fun to do a few runs with that and then say \"Click 2, <a href=\"/en/card/02026\">Notoriety</a>.  Click 3, <a href=\"/en/card/09030\">Apocalypse</a>, Click 4 run archives, GG.\"</p>\n\n<p>In testing, I kept balancing out the number of <a href=\"/en/card/02026\">Notoriety</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/10080\">Out of the Ashes</a>.  1 and 5 respectively is what I settled on and it did a good job.  The 2 <a href=\"/en/card/11030\">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a>s were a late addition that also did a lot of lifting.  While there isn't any real multi-access plan, this was a blast to play.  I could try to fit in some <a href=\"/en/card/01036\">The Maker's Eye</a>s, but i did well by just timing my Apocs to maximize the chances I would steal something they had out.</p>\n", "user_id": 20581, "user_name": "plural", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10080": 5, "11030": 2, "11085": 1, "11109": 3, "21106": 2, "21108": 3, "22019": 2, "25042": 3, "25044": 1, "25059": 3, "26019": 1, "26025": 2, "03037": 1, "03038": 3, "03046": 3, "03053": 3, "03054": 2, "06099": 2, "09030": 3, "09038": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57355": {"id": 57355, "date_creation": "2019-10-11T07:47:47+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-12T13:58:26+00:00", "name": "Skorpios Astronautics - 19th @ Crown of Lasers 2019", "description": "<p>This is the corp deck I brought to the Crown of Lasers this year, going 3-1.<br />You can see it in action <a href=\"https://m.twitch.tv/videos/490007222?t=2h30m10s\">here</a>.<br />My runner was Kabonesa Wu, check out the Worlds decklist for a writeup.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to play a fast deck that had to be in either HB or Weyland, and having only 30 mins or so to decide what ID I should play I somehow ended up choosing Jemison.

I've been experimenting a bit with Spec Work in Kabonesa, because you can pull out unnecessary silver bullets for the match up and just eat them to speed up and thin the deck at the same time. I liked the way the deck was going, but it felt like I had soo many slots filled up and there was no room to breathe. That's where this deck comes in. It's one of the usual shaper decks, but with some twists and weird tricks. Don't ask me why, I mean, you should be asking the Apex players what they're doing anyway, don't mind me.</p>\n\n<p>@ Crown of Lasers I was on -1 FTE -1 Feedback Filter +1 Notoriety +1 Takobi, and ofc I got to play vs 2 PE (you can watch me lose vs one of those <a href=\"https://m.twitch.tv/videos/490007222?t=2h55m00s\">here</a>), plus one corp I can't seem to remember and 1 NEH (which should be a good matchup for me), going 1-3 (as far as I recall). <br />I made SO MANY mistakes during the whole weekend, stuff like being one credit short to pull out the tricks I needed to, trashing the wrong card while using Compile and being full MU and so on. At least I can say i learned a lot.</p>\n\n<p>@ Worlds I made another set of mistakes during the day, ending with a 1-6 result, but I also played some very good games where everything came down to a Batty psy (I'm looking at you Swabl). I played against a good deal of Palanas and Weylands, and the deck was ready for those matchup.</p>\n\n<p>@ Standard pod I had some form of redemption, going 2-1. I basically just started playing more loosely, the deck always had my back and I was able to do so much more than previously.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I know there's no D4V1D, I know, but hear me out. <br />Deus X is so good, it breaks a good deal of annoying ice you'd break with D4 (especially vs Jinteki, which was the flavor of the day) + being able to break anything in combination with Pelangi, while still helping SO much against IG (Ronin) together with Imp. <br />By the way, that devil kitty has done SO MUCH too, be it vs asset spam, vs Obokatas or SSLs or vs HHNs and other ugly operations coming from HQ.</p>\n\n<p>Scavenges and Rejigs allow you to abuse some of your cards or simply installing Rezekis turn 1 for much less.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, money slots in Kabonesa are a bit tight as you often depend a lot on Rezekis for econ, so I decided to add some Falsified (to help against La Costa) and Kati. I wish I had more copies of Compile too. There's no ProCo, so often you don't draw as much as Hayleys. Having more copies of it helps as it's more recursion and remote pressure. Playing Femme + Pelangi with it also gets you through some ugly remotes you wouldn't be able to get through otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>I'm happy with the deck, not with my performance. As usual there's room for improvement, I'll try to test and abuse soon-to-be-rotated cards more, as there's not much time left for that.</p>\n\n<p>I want to thank everyone so, so much.

Additionally, with Excalibur floating around, we <em>need</em> an AI. To that end, the circus package (Brahman, Lady, D4v1d, Cyber-Cypher) is perfect \u2014 it gives early-game efficiency, and when you start running low on counters, you can transition in the late-game to recycle them with Brahman.</p>\n\n<p>Generally the times the deck loses are (along with bad piloting by me...)</p>\n\n<ol><li>You have your breakers but don't have all three Rezekis dripping</li>\n<li>You have three Rezekis but don't have enough MU for your breakers</li>\n</ol><p>The reason why \"rushed out\" isn't here is because it's actually really difficult to rush out Wu.

Astrolabe just doesn't cut it when you are so MU hungry, so I ended up settling on Daredevil, expecting lots of Palana \u2014 it fights Data Loop and Kakugo very well.

I had long believed that Apoc was going to be an important card at Worlds, and I don\u2019t think I was wrong there. I also believed that corps were going to go fast and have key events. I therefore would have loved to have played <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/50578/apocalpyse-maxx-top-58-5-at-euros-\">Apox Maxx</a> that I played at Euros last year to good effect (good enough for me anyway, top 60 is a delight as far as I am concerned and don\u2019t let anyone tell you differently) .  </p>\n\n<p>There was just a one big problem though; those dastardly Nisei types had put Paperclip on the restricted list. Were they wrong to do so? I don\u2019t think so but it was still problematic. It was my very first experience of being hit with by an MWL, typically MWLs have completely ignored my decks for some strange reason.</p>\n\n<p>So I did dutifully try and be a good player and play with corroder and Levy but it was awkward. I was constantly trying to keep an eye on corroders and Levy whilst still keeping an eye on the game. That\u2019s when I started to wonder. What if you played Maxx\u2026 without putting cards back in the deck</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SerpentineImpureHagfish-small.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>And that lead to various iterations with 99 cards because of course it did, but over time I actually started to become convinced that there was something here and I\u2019m reasonably happy that I\u2019ve proven I was on to something.</p>\n\n<p>And the number you come up with if you say \"OK in an ideal Maxx game I want to Levy once and not quite draw the whole deck\" is somewhere between 77 and 85 . And I landed on 81 after cutting Dirty Laundry</p>\n\n<p>As with every apoc deck you have to neatly balance yourself so you are in a position to money &amp; draw up if necessary, to pressure the remote if necessary, or fire the Apoc if the timing is right. Some cards do double duty but I think most of them fit into that slot. Run Amok is wildly powerful in this deck and DDOS is just as much there to pressure the remote if the corp tries to rush out while you don't have necessary breakers or attack cards. </p>\n\n<p>As the day got closer I found that my most important match up was the Weyland with meat damage one so I found room for the Networking and Sports Hopper; both of these did excellent work on the day. </p>\n\n<p>On the day it beat 1 Argus (though this was very close to a loss), 1 Azmari, 1 IG (though only on the narrowest of victories and a prayer to the Gods of Jank and wild plays),  1 Blue Sun (dream start though), 1 Palana, 1 SportsMetal, </p>\n\n<p>Lost to 1 Azmari (rused into wasting attacks on an NGO then got well rushed out on 5/3s), 1 Palana (well played Beckett, awesome Thimblerig placement) &amp; 1 Argus (though I missed the winning combo 3 times with HQ runs on an Imp)</p>\n\n<p>I should move on from this but boy\u2026. This deck is a fun and wild ride. </p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://media0.giphy.com/media/a0CR5gejuOdqg/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>P,S, \nI have been asked how I shuffled this.

My very first version was <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/49738/loss-adjusted-response-activation\" title=\"First Published Lara\">back in April 2018</a> and since then I\u2019ve had the privilege of placing what I considered highly (top 60) at Euros, dropped a rock on someone at Nationals, won the Readox bell on multiple occasions and sacked a Government Takeover.</p>\n\n<p>I never dreamed however that this deck would reward my attention and service with a Worlds playmat. Thank you deck, and the runner deck that went with it (81 card Maxx)</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to talk about this deck because I never know where to start. When one publishes a typically known archetype with some spice/entirely correct alternate card then you can explain those choices and then go from there.  That can lead me to want to explain everything at length but on the other hand I don\u2019t want to come across as someone who thinks he is the only person to have discovered Mushin, Jemison, City Works, Junebugs etc. </p>\n\n<p>I will err on the side of the overexplain so please feel free to tut and say \u201cUgh\u2026 obviously\u201d where appropriate.\nThe basic premise of the deck is to put the runner in a fork as soon as possible, ideally before they realise the exact nature of the fork.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand if they run a trap the trap might become more advanced after they commit to access using a surprise upgrade or asset to add advancement counters with Jemison\u2019s ability.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand if they leave you alone (and go down to less than 5 in hand) you can score an Armed Intimidation and follow up with a Boom!</p>\n\n<p>In and around that you can as the corp be doing things to improve your odds; getting the runner to lose cards to a trap can increase the chances of the runner going lower in hand size, scoring agendas can make them feel they need to challenge advanced remotes, and scoring bigger agendas allow for bigger sacrifices to make bigger plays on the above. Sometimes as well you can just score out. </p>\n\n<p>The Agenda suite in these decks has tended to wobble around depending on my willingness to play City Works project. If, because of Film Critic largely, I do not want to play City works project you tend to end up with an odder suite and slightly more traps. As it was I realised a little while before worlds that with the threat I was leaning into of the unadvanced remote being \u201cnot worth a random check\u201d it meant that I could put Malia on the table as my \u201cout\u201d for scoring a City Works vs Film Critic. Of course I would have to practice my acting that I forgot about Film Critic, or did not expect it, but it felt like a worthy play to aim for. \nAs it was I never used it, but the freedom to play City Works was huge for me.  Aki Mitchell has long been an advocate of City Works in this kind of list and while I think there are times I will go elsewhere I do think it makes a very potent threat. Her insight into Jemison and the way in which I could compare notes with another player has been valuable to me. </p>\n\n<p>The rest of the agenda suite is fairly obvious; 3 Armed Intimidations mean your \u201cscore Armed Intimidation into Boom!\u201d threat is likely to be accessible whilst 3 Standoffs and 3 Hostiles allow for considerable sacking potential, as well as reasonable econ. Atlas never feels bad and if you aren\u2019t on City works then you tend to squeeze far more Atlas in.\nJunebugs win a lot of games on their own and you absolutely, in my belief, need at least 3 advanceable traps even with the City Works. The 3 Psychic Fields are also very necessary to make checking random face downs really unappealing, and to deal with 419 and other expose effects. </p>\n\n<p>Quarantine System and Oberth Protocol are the pieces of the puzzle that help Jemison sack out agenda points after access in order to increase the damage of traps or City Works. They can, alternatively, help to very rapidly score out an Armed Intimidation.  Quarantine System in particular is notable for allowing you to sack multiple agendas in the same window. Thanks to Simon Castle for first putting me on to this. </p>\n\n<p>Reconstruction Contract actually works far better with Atlas and I feel less keen on them in this deck than in others. They are a great Mushin target however as if they are left on the table they allow considerable shenanigans. \n3 Boom! is obvious and definitely stronger in this list than HPT even with its inherent weakness to being trashed. The 3 Dedication Ceremony are largely there for City Works now but have done some duty with the Reconstruction Contract in extremis.</p>\n\n<p>The 3 Mushin no Shin are of course great, but the best plays are often with City Works because the interplay is utterly wild.</p>\n\n<p>The ice suite has to be tight and each ice has to work on its own because of that. It also has to work with whatever the runner is valuing; that means a lot of ETR is necessary with only Maouslus being allowed to skip that because runners taking a tag and a net damage is nearly always fine for me. Due to the need to keep some agendas in the score area ready to be trashed it does limit the usage of Archer and Tithonium but they feel like they are at the right numbers here.</p>\n\n<p>On the day it beat 1 Freedom, 2 Val, one 419, one Apoc Omar, 1 Smoke (before I could use the Malia), 1 Apoc Alice (though this matchup rightly terrified me)</p>\n\n<p>Lost to 1 Apoc Val, 1 Reg Val (though I was thiiiiis close to a successful ruse, my opponent sighed with relief after having exactly the right amount of cards by happenstance and whispered quitely \"Why did I run that...\"), </p>\n\n<p>Weirdly I don\u2019t think I\u2019m done with this ID. I still find it surprising that it hasn\u2019t taken off more. I might try a more conventional deck though with less Mushin and thus more ice to see where that takes me.</p>\n", "user_id": 11224, "user_name": "Cliquil", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 3, "11058": 3, "11097": 3, "12016": 1, "12017": 1, "12018": 3, "12077": 3, "12098": 1, "21020": 2, "21057": 3, "21069": 2, "21078": 3, "25089": 3, "25124": 3, "25126": 1, "25130": 2, "25135": 3, "25146": 3, "26058": 1, "05010": 3, "05015": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.2"}, "57368": {"id": 57368, "date_creation": "2019-10-11T14:49:09+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-20T17:39:25+00:00", "name": "Fair and vegan 6zmari (#106 at Worlds)", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 24742, "user_name": "lostgeek", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10110": 1, "11080": 1, "11119": 1, "21015": 2, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21054": 1, "21055": 3, "21074": 2, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "22039": 1, "23045": 3, "23054": 2, "25115": 1, "25116": 2, "25139": 2, "25143": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "27006": 1, "06111": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57369": {"id": 57369, "date_creation": "2019-10-11T16:06:57+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-11T16:06:57+00:00", "name": "Worlds 419", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 16515, "user_name": "Tolaasin", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"26018": 2, "21106": 3, "11004": 1, "21104": 1, "25032": 2, "25010": 1, "21064": 3, "11008": 3, "26026": 2, "21105": 3, "25007": 2, "12105": 1, "25030": 1, "09035": 1, "25059": 3, "10085": 2, "12104": 3, "03053": 3, "26016": 1, "11030": 1, "21044": 3, "25060": 3, "21063": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57370": {"id": 57370, "date_creation": "2019-10-11T16:55:50+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-11T17:37:36+00:00", "name": "Lady Luck's Chuchu Train  (3-4 at worlds)", "description": "<p>Are you bored of playing long games?

Against credit denial crims you are probably happier playing Palana, but against Apocalypse decks I would much rather be on AgInfusion. Given the decks I faced, it seems I made the correct choice for this tournament :).</p>\n\n<p>Below I will go over my card choices, most of which will probably be obvious for experienced players, but maybe it will help some people new to the archetype or the game in general. If you have any questions leave them in the comments, and I will try and answer as best I can.</p>\n\n<p>Agendas:</p>\n\n<p>3 Nisei MK II: Not much to say about this one, if your deck intends to build a scoring remote play 3.</p>\n\n<p>1 Timely Public Release: I like this as the fourth 2 pointer. It combines with Border Control to make a worse Nisei. Given that I prefer a worse Nisei to the other options is a testament to how good that agenda is. If you don't like TPR, you could try a Corporate Sales Team (more money is good), or a Philotic Entanglement (being able to never advance can be nice). During Worlds it didn't end up mattering, since I never scored the TPR...</p>\n\n<p>3 SSL Endorsement: While 3 pointers that protect themselves are very nice, I think the deck simply needs the extra money from SSL to function.</p>\n\n<p>1 The Future Perfect: I like this as the fourth 3 pointer, it doesn't do anything for you if scored, but it protecting itself is worth a lot, it straight up won me a game during swiss in which the runner found it 3 times on HQ but didn't win any of the psi games. I personally don't like Obokata in decks that don't tax the runners cards in any other way, plus it would mean giving up Mother Goddess as restricted card.</p>\n\n<p>Assets:</p>\n\n<p>3 Rashida Jaheem: Not much to say, gives a lot of resources for a very low cost.</p>\n\n<p>3 NGO Front: Serviceable as a straight up money card, but most of the value comes from having something other than an agenda to advance in your remote to keep the runner guessing.</p>\n\n<p>2 Daily Quest: If one of these ticks for even 2 turns its a decent card, if it ticks for 4+ turns it's just disgusting. That said, they weren't that good for me during the tournament, but that might be due to the matchups I had, since 8 out of the 9 games were either Freedom or on Apocalypse, which demand early ice on your centrals, usually leaving none for an early remote. I like these two slots being money cards, just not sure if these are the best ones yet.</p>\n\n<p>Operations:</p>\n\n<p>3 Hedge Fund, 3 IPO, 3 Celebrity Gift: These give you money, this decks needs a lot of money. On Gift: I feel a lot of people are too scared to show agendas with these. Of course you don't want to show the runner you are flooded, but I will almost always show a hand with 1 agenda, since generally running through whatever ice you have on HQ to get a 1 in 5 chance of finding an agenda is not worth it, especially early on in the game. I would never play less than 3 in Jinteki glacier, going from 3 to 10 is just too good, especially versus econ denial decks.</p>\n\n<p>1 Preemptive Action: I tend to like exactly 1 Preemptive in my glacier decks, for a little recursion. Best use during Worlds was shuffling 3 ice back in after an early Apocalypse. You can use this to shuffle back in agendas, but you have to risk the runner getting them from archives for 1 turn. That said, this is probably the first card I would cut if I needed room for something else.</p>\n\n<p>2 Digital Rights Management: Really good new addition for Jinteki glacier decks, effectively lets you play more Nisei's. The advantage over Fast Track is that you can still score a 5/3 that you got the turn after. This makes your ideal scoring pattern of Nisei-Nisei-5/3 way more consistent. The downside of not being able to play it if the runner successfully ran HQ last turn is usually not that big of a deal for a glacier deck that likes to protect its centrals. So far I have liked having 2 copies.</p>\n\n<p>Upgrades:</p>\n\n<p>3 Marcus Batty: These allow you to try and fire the Excalibur subroutine even if the runner can break it normally. Alternatively, you can use them as extra etr's, either on the remote or on centrals to give even more protection against high impact run events than the ID ability already gives you.</p>\n\n<p>Ice:</p>\n\n<p>3 Anansi, 3 DNA Tracker: These are your hard hitters and ideal targets to force people into with your ID ability. Most breakers suites have trouble breaking one or both of these repeatedly (looking at you bin breakers). Against decks with Hippo I tend to not put these on the outside, even though it gives up a lot of value from your ID, getting your 8 cost ice destroyed is really rough. Against all other decks, try to have at least one of these somewhere on the outside, preferably the one they have the most trouble breaking of course.</p>\n\n<p>3 Excalibur: One of the main reasons to play AgInfusion, if the runner can't deal with it yet you can force them through it using your ID ability. If it is on the remote the runner often has to be able to break it multiple times due to the various etr effects in this deck, which can be a real problem if they rely on Engolo or Pelangi to break it. Sometime rezzing a second Excalibur can be worth it to ensure it fires, but of course you lose the first one.</p>\n\n<p>2 Thimblerig: Ice positioning is very important for this deck and these help you rearrange your ice for the best result. Examples are putting rezzed ice on the outside versus DDOS or putting an unrezzed ice at the bottom of your remote as fodder for your ID ability.</p>\n\n<p>2 Mother Goddess: I chose this as my restricted card, sometimes it helps you rush out an early Nisei which is incredibly useful. Also useful against Apocalypse decks which tend to not allow you to rez your early ice on centrals, meaning this can be unbreakable without an AI for quite some time. If they are not ready for the Apocalypse yet they have to choose between giving you an uncontestable remote or letting you rez more ice on centrals. Later on this is kind of like a worse Bastion, which is actually fine in some situations, like after purging a Turtle. If you draw it too late you can at least use it to fuel your ID ability. Other options for restricted cards I considered are GFI and Obokata, but I feel you really are better of running Mother Godess and SSL Endorsement, since this deck needs a lot of money.</p>\n\n<p>3 Border Control: An early etr subroutine to protect Rashida or Daily Quest and and on demand guaranteed etr later on in the game, what more could you want from a piece of ice?</p>\n\n<p>1 Swordsman: Great against Turtle, generally not so great against most other things. The beauty of AgInfusion is that in matchups were its not good, you can just use it as fuel for your ID. Also considered Macrophage for this slot, which serves a similar purpose.</p>\n\n<p>1 Sadaka: Mostly to kill Net Mercur in the Smoke matchup, or Turning Wheel in any deck that runs it. If there are no good targets, use it for your ID ability.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I want to thank all the nice people I met (either again or for the first time) over the weekend, making it another great Netrunner experience, and Nisei for organizing a very well run event!</p>\n", "user_id": 23109, "user_name": "Magnetar", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11053": 3, "11080": 1, "12052": 1, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21051": 3, "21073": 1, "21080": 3, "22039": 2, "25087": 3, "25096": 1, "25100": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26048": 2, "27006": 2, "28005": 3, "28006": 1, "05007": 1, "06010": 2, "06111": 3, "08074": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57346": {"id": 57346, "date_creation": "2019-10-10T12:27:44+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-19T13:46:32+00:00", "name": "Yet another Hayley deck (12th at Worlds 2019)", "description": "<p>Fairly standard Hayley deck, not much to say.

So I switched out the Engolo, the Na'Not'K and the Takobi for a Brahman, a Cyber-Cypher and an Ika. Below are my thoughts on the changes I made, if you have any other questions feel free to ask them in the comments and I will try and answer them.</p>\n\n<p>On the changes I made: I didn't like the Na'Not'K+Takobi combination for dealing with annoying sentries, and Na'Not'K on its own is very inefficient against some ice configurations (like an Architect being the only ice on a server). Against big servers with multiple sentries I found that Ika+D4v1d+Brahman generally does the job as well. The disadvantage of Ika is that the corp can destroy it by overwriting their ice, but generally I have not found that to be an issue considering the deck has backup breakers and Clone Chips. Cyber-Cypher is just an incredibly efficient breaker that usually goes on either R&amp;D or the remote. If needed you can use Brahman to reset it. Brahman allows you to reset Lady and D4v1d as well which can be nice in long games, or when playing versus glacier in the case of D4v1d.</p>\n\n<p>The deck went 4-3 in swiss, and 0-2 in the cut though I think I got a little unlucky in the cut.

This friendly little family business deck went undefeated during Day 1 at Worlds 2019. Unfortunately I only managed to win a single Runner game, so no Day 2 for me. Lots of people still asked for the list, so here we go.</p>\n\n<p>I have played different versions of this deck in several tournaments before, always with pretty good success. It got better when <a href=\"/en/card/26056\">SDS Drone Deployment</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a> came out, but with the brand new <a href=\"/en/card/26117\">Digital Rights Management</a> it reached peak performance. It is easy and straightforward to play and never goes to time, which makes it a great tournament choice to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>For a long time I have felt that Runners are too rich to reliably kill them with <a href=\"/en/card/11016\">Hard-Hitting News</a> + <a href=\"/en/card/21119\">High-Profile Target</a>. You needed just too many tech cards like <a href=\"/en/card/21036\">Economic Warfare</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/06066\">Reversed Accounts</a> to land the punishment. Just throw all that garbage away and replace it with rush and rigshooting tools.</p>\n\n<p>The Outfit is much better for this archetype than Argus, since nobody can come back from low money like The Outfit. Feel free to pump loads of cash into <a href=\"/en/card/21059\">Trojan Horse</a> if you can lock them out for a few turns. <a href=\"/en/card/21080\">Rashida Jaheem</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/22056\">Too Big to Fail</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25124\">Hostile Takeover</a> will bring you back quickly enough.</p>\n\n<p>Shapers are the easiest matchup in my experience. This deck is just blazing fast and you often sit on 4-5 points with one or two Atlas tokens by the time they can contest. Scoring an <a href=\"/en/card/26056\">SDS Drone Deployment</a> helps throwing them back during setup, but against Shaper I'd rather see <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile Takeover</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/08058\">Oaktown Renovation</a> for the forward tempo to make sure I am faster than they are.</p>\n\n<p>Criminals pressure much faster. Against them I often mulligan for tons of money and <a href=\"/en/card/05024\">Guard</a> to rush behind. If you get a <a href=\"/en/card/22056\">Too Big to Fail</a> and some other money card in your starting hand, you might not even ice HQ turn 1 if you can start rushing with Guard+Atlas/Oaktown instead. Later in the game their lack of recursion often makes sure you can safely score out after shooting the main breaker with <a href=\"/en/card/21059\">Trojan Horse</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/08074\">Marcus Batty</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Anarchs are the trickiest. Against them, barriers become the most important ice, since Corroder cannot come back from the bin as easily as the other breakers. Have <a href=\"/en/card/11050\">Ark Lockdown</a> / <a href=\"/en/card/10094\">Consulting Visit</a> handy to get rid of bin breakers. Don't wait until all three copies are in the bin. Sometimes you have to take the gamble and lock down a single one to get a quick scoring window.\nFreedom Khumalo seems like the toughest matchup, but he often needs a bit of setup time. That is where a well-timed <a href=\"/en/card/26117\">Digital Rights Management</a> and/or a <a href=\"/en/card/08074\">Marcus Batty</a> firing on <a href=\"/en/card/26060\">Trebuchet</a> (to shoot the <a href=\"/en/card/21062\">Knobkierie</a>) can become necessary to save the day.</p>\n\n<p>Most important tip: Don't worry about bad publicity! Sure, runs will be cheap. But the ice is not meant to be taxing anyway. It's all gear checks and Batty fodder.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: One more thing: Although it is tempting to throw CVS into the bin against Freedom and Aumakua users, don't! Rather install it somewhere and fire it when they are about to encounter Tithonium.</p>\n\n<p>Shoutouts go to Lazychef13 for the refinement theorycrafting before Worlds, to RvdH, who suggested <a href=\"/en/card/06010\">Mother Goddess</a> over <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a>, which was a fantastic call, and of course to all the people I met/fought at Worlds and the unbelievably amazing people in this community in general!</p>\n\n<p>11/10; will rush again!</p>\n", "user_id": 21592, "user_name": "Pommes", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11050": 2, "11098": 1, "12058": 1, "12098": 2, "21059": 2, "21080": 3, "22050": 1, "22056": 3, "23054": 3, "25076": 1, "25124": 2, "25125": 3, "25126": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26056": 2, "26058": 3, "26060": 1, "27006": 1, "05024": 3, "06010": 1, "07027": 2, "08074": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57348": {"id": 57348, "date_creation": "2019-10-10T15:15:13+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-11T11:02:57+00:00", "name": "Burleigh Adams v3 (aka World's 2nd best Adam)", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 8548, "user_name": "Hammers", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11085": 1, "11087": 2, "12104": 1, "12109": 1, "21028": 3, "21029": 2, "21089": 3, "21107": 1, "21108": 1, "25007": 2, "25010": 1, "25017": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 3, "25065": 2, "26016": 1, "03053": 3, "08049": 1, "09035": 1, "09037": 1, "09039": 3, "09040": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57349": {"id": 57349, "date_creation": "2019-10-10T15:18:23+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-10T15:18:23+00:00", "name": "Recurrent recurrent user Spen- BOOM", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 8548, "user_name": "Hammers", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10092": 1, "11016": 2, "11058": 1, "11060": 2, "11094": 3, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "22030": 2, "22046": 2, "23045": 2, "25072": 3, "25082": 2, "25105": 1, "25108": 3, "25112": 2, "25114": 3, "25115": 2, "25119": 1, "25120": 2, "25142": 2, "26049": 3, "09004": 1, "09007": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57350": {"id": 57350, "date_creation": "2019-10-10T15:26:35+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-10T22:41:35+00:00", "name": "Smooth Jazz Apocalypse (40th @ Nisei Worlds)", "description": "<p>For Nisei Worlds 2019, the NYC testing crew spent about 80% of its testing time on 419 and Palana, and eventually realized that Anarchs and assets had a serious leg up on the competition. This was great news for me because I'm a garbage tier crim. Freedom and <a href=\"/en/card/09030\">Apocalypse</a> Val were both on the docket for what we'd want to run, and then on my flight to Amsterdam listening to KLM's amazing \"Dutch Dance Essentials\" and \"Dutch Number 1's - The 80s,\" I was delivered a sign:  </p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/640x480q90/922/VWYMth.png\" alt=\"Smooth Jazz Apocalypse on KLM Radio\" /> . </p>\n\n<p>This list started with NYC's @groenkaaf putting together a resource-intensive <a href=\"/en/card/08103\">DDoS</a>-focused Apocalypse deck. The big decision was whether to <a href=\"/en/card/11008\">Deuces Wild</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/12104\">Aumakua</a> with the spare influence. Deuces was helpful in determining inner ICE to apoc, but turtles ended up being more flexible for actually dealing with any Excalibur shenanigans and to <a href=\"/en/card/10083\">Rebirth</a>-Freedom any assets matchups.  </p>\n\n<p>I appreciated the <em>smooth</em> consistency of this deck with a huge heap of 3x cards. I often would struggle with draw order in Freedom and knowing when to deploy which strategies, so this played relatively linearly. I was even convinced at the last minute to go up to 3x MKUltra and 3x Stargate at the last minute, which felt like overkill, but definitely helped against Blue Sun.    </p>\n\n<p>Speaking of which, the 1x <a href=\"/en/card/07044\">Archives Interface</a> was a desperate attempt to stymy Industrial Genomics, who we thought would emerge as the dominant corp archetype in this meta. Unfortunately we were right, and Freedom surged into the top tables and dismantled a bunch of our plans. I did install this once on the day but died trying to use it.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Round 1</em><br /><strong>Argus (Ryan from Australia)</strong>\nTraditionally a tough matchup for anarchs, Argus proved to be too much rush for Val. I let an Atlas get scored with a counter, so when another one was installed and advanced, I had to contest. I was able to clear three tags from the first HHN, but the second one stuck. This led to a frantic tag me strategy looking to delete his HPTs. <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a> helped me avoid immediate death and nab a bunch of agendas, but it was not quite enough! More importantly, Ryan gave me a cute tiny koala brandishing an Australian flag! <strong>0-1</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Round 2</em><br /><strong>PE (Keith from Glasgow)</strong>\nStargate did so much work in this MU. I was able to eat a couple News Teams for tags with some savvy accesses, and root out a couple Obokatas from centrals. With the Stargate down I was able to trash some of his FA tech. Even though I needed to take a Shikyu, I was able to Stargate into the win. <strong>1-1</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Round 3</em><br /><strong>Outfit (Jim from Oxford)</strong>\nThe first apoc hit in this game in a somewhat interesting way. Trebuchet was rezzed on an early <a href=\"/en/card/07035\">Wanton Destruction</a> (that did trash a DDoS of mine), which ultimately helped me with the apoc because it trashed my <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a> for me. Then my R&amp;D run also ended up trashing a breaker when I stole SDS. Since so much ICE was devoted to centrals, he was unable to bounce back. Jim became famous as the guy who was giving out \"gingercreds,\" tiny gingerbread cookies sculpted from a 3D printed credit mold! <strong>2-1</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Round 4</em><br /><strong>IG (David from NYC)</strong>\nOf course I had to play one of my testing partners and meta-mates, David. It wasn't totally a mirror match because he chose Freedom and I chose Val. However, I know this IG deck card  for card. It... didn't really help me. I was unable to keep my card draw up after an early <a href=\"/en/card/06120\">Earthrise Hotel</a> and his board state kept growing. I was able to install the Archives Interface at an unacceptable tempo loss. In order to contest the board I had to attempt double-iced archives. Turns out he was able to find 2x Cortex Lock for it. Rip. After the game he told me that once the Interface went down, he Genotyped the Breached Domes out of archives for more central damage. I didn't really stand a chance! <strong>2-2</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Round 5</em><br /><strong>Blue Sun (Ben from Cambridge)</strong>\nBen and I played different decks together in CoL, so it was nice to match up again. This game came after and incredibly stressful and long IG game that he won masterfully going through basically his whole deck. I don't remember too much about this matchup because the IG game was so epic. <strong>3-2</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Round 6</em><br /><strong>Blue Sun (Andrew from Liverpool)</strong>\nThis was a super-intense matchup that came down to the final turn. He barely tried to score and I barely tried to run. Each deciding to hoard credits. He was on Punitive and we both knew it, so I had to be a little careful. I took some pokes at HQ and archives to try to force Border Controls and found HQ lightly defended. On the Apoc turn I actually hit an SDS in HQ. I felt a little too poor and thought I could just grab it after apoc so I declined to steal. My next run on archives yielded <strong>two SSLs</strong>. Uh oh. Instead of finishing the apoc and getting Punitived for 6 net, I ran HQ click 3 and trashed an NGO. With no real money left, I ran last click, let Sapper nab my Paperclip, and hit the SDS for the win.  <strong>4-2</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Round 7</em><br /><strong>NEH (Matthias from Sweden)</strong>\nThis felt like a crazy unlucky matchup for Matthias. NEH is so prone to apoc it hurts. He knew it was coming from the moment I ran HQ (he tried to rush out a score before the apoc). After the apoc turn I was able to Stargate a couple agendas and it was over before turn 5. <strong>5-2</strong>   </p>\n\n<p><em>Round 8</em><br /><strong>AgInfusion (Marc from Belgium)</strong>\nThis might have been my proudest game in the tournament. I have played a fair amount of Ag in my day, so I have a feel for the ICE and how much money you need. I realized it would be a pretty hard matchup if I forced too many outer ICE rezzes, so I decided to only attack with DDoS. I lucked out on an NGO, but then he was able to get a Nisei token. After that I needed to apply more pressure so he couldn't chain the tokens out. I used a DDoS to attempt an apoc, but he was able to stuff the final run with Nisei. With that cleared up, I was finally able to find Omar to get through the thin ICE on archives. After much hemming and hawing, I landed the Apoc, but it wasn't super simple from there. I only had four cards in hand and knew there was an Obo in HQ. I had to decide whether to take it or leave it and install the Stargate from hand OR use the Wanton in hand. Either way I would be able to steal no more Obos. So I steeled my courage and took the Obo, bringing me down to 0 cards in stack and 0 cards in hand. A few more Omar pokes yielded the final agenda.  <strong>6-2</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Round 9</em><br /><strong>NEH (Fabian from ???)</strong><br />\nThis was a wild finish to my tournament. I discovered very quickly that this deck had some Door to Door shenanigans, but I could not find my resource economy quickly enough. He was able to just barely land an HHN, which didn't seem like the end of the world except that Door to Door kept taxing me bit by bit. I may have been too aggressive trying to clear it by stealing an agenda. I assumed it was 1x Boom and I could Stargate lock it away, but he already had a Consulting Visit in hand for the win. <strong>6-3</strong>.  </p>\n\n<p>Big thank you to the NYC competitive group for help testing and moral support throughout the day.

We decided to go all Murder Corp &amp; all Apoc Runner and I had to play HB &amp; Shaper! (Why?)<br />\nSo I've got a tipp in looking into a deck CodeMarvelous was playing on steam and decided I transfer it into Mirror as the 6 credits Sports give you (3 Agendas scored or stolen before you win), you can easily make with Mirror. And I love the interaction with <a href=\"/en/card/12111\">MCA Austerity Policy</a> and other cards like <a href=\"/en/card/21039\">NGO Front</a>.<br />\nBiggest regret that I could not win the MirrorMirrorID!<br />\nBut you could watch our team mate Saan playing on Stream in round 5! So we made it to the 3rd &amp; table one during the tournament ending as 12th which was already over performing.<br />\nI've changed some pieces removed <a href=\"/en/card/11079\">Best Defense</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/11119\">Macrophage</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/21080\">Rashida Jaheem</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/01059\">Biotic Labor</a> and switched from <a href=\"/en/card/21010\">Ikawah Project</a> to <a href=\"/en/card/10048\">Voting Machine Initiative</a>. This was a bad switch as I never scored one! Added more ICE and another <a href=\"/en/card/12031\">Load Testing</a>. Not sure if removing <a href=\"/en/card/21080\">Rashida Jaheem</a> &amp; <a href=\"/en/card/01059\">Biotic Labor</a> was a smart move, to be honest.<br />\nWithout practice this was a hard thing, but I managed to kill 2 runners and one found the winning agenda on top of R&amp;D before dying....  and playing lot's of shapers...<br />\nThank you for all my opponents!</p>\n\n<h2>Match 1 don't know his name on Smoke</h2>\n\n<p>He was so rich and made me richer with PioT. But I managed to steal 2 of his clicks + 4 tags. His run on R&amp;D saved him from a Rocket right into his home....</p>\n\n<h2>Match 2 terrificy on Val</h2>\n\n<p>Strong start for him, until I was able to <a href=\"/en/card/12111\">MCA Austerity Policy</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/12031\">Load Testing</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/11016\">Hard-Hitting News</a> him, with <a href=\"/en/card/11058\">BOOM!</a> waiting in Archives.</p>\n\n<h2>Match 3 iref on Heyley</h2>\n\n<p>Putting down Tech Trader turn 1 closed the game for me, it was a matter of time.

I also found that she had huge antisynergy with liberateds. So while complaining about this (\"I want an event that costs credits and gives me money but I cant come up with anything\") @lostgeek proposed putting in Day Job and @tutgetgut said it sounded good.\nIt later turned out that Asger was just memeing, but I still found it much better than Lib (10c for 4 clicks instead of 5), also because I am a terrible player and often install Lib when I shouldn't, and it's way easier to avoid these dumb decisions if the tempo hit is so obvious as it is with day job.</p>\n\n<h2>Tech choices.</h2>\n\n<p>Anyhow I decided that turtle was a bad AI solution (because you need 3 counters to deal with excal) and <strong>pelangi</strong> lets you break stupid non-barrier ice with paperclip which is good. I think these were good choices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Polop</strong> deals with a lot of incidental stuff, but also jeeves and recoco, because I was scared of being too slow for the asa matchup. If you draw this card early your matchup against both combo and sft asa are pretty okay. #sloptheplop</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pad taps</strong> synergize well with mining accident and the idea is to slow the corp down or speed you up so you can take more clickdraws. This is sound theory, unfortunately not good enough vs. Weyland rush who can just run away without trashing them.</p>\n\n<p>What was not a good choice was not playing more draw.

Almost every factions has high impact successful run effects. Most importantly, stops Apoc, Stargate and Diversion of Funds. It even triggers with ASA. Never sad to have drawn one. </p>\n\n<p>2x Ichi and 1x Loki: both we picked for the same reason. In faction and super awkward to break while being below 5 strength. I ran into some problems in testing when playing against D4 recursion - these two provide reasonable solutions. Loki also functions as early protection against non-AI Apoc. While late game becoming a non-clickable ichi or fairchild. </p>\n\n<p>1 x Advanced Assembly Lines: took the spot of the third IPO for many reasons. Its early money, triggers with ASA and or Jinja, acts as a sick Architect target, can be used a bluffed Vitruvius. All those upsides outweighed the downsides of being trash-able and weak to hacktivist. </p>\n\n<p>The lack of Barriers: I was afraid of Freedoms Jusuf, so I included just enough barriers to make the runner get a fracter and tax mainly with the other subtypes.</p>\n\n<p>This deck lost (I think this was its only loss, please correct me otherwise) to ToThBeBe's masterfully played Adam.

I was on goodstuff 419 and did pretty poorly with it, even though the deck was quite decent. Too many mistakes. Apologies to those who picked me in their Betrunner-team. ;)</p>\n\n<p>My corp games on the other hand went way better, as usual. This deck went 6-1 in swiss losing only to Wilfy who just outplayed me. The next day it went 3-0 in a Standard side tournament. Argus is still my favourite corporation to play competitively. It is fast and can still win even when you're way behind.</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/d63a2c43f2c0a32b705e4f1bdad94d47/tumblr_o7tg4a8IbF1s2wio8o1_500.gif\" width=\"500\" alt=\"tumblr_o7tg4a8IbF1s2wio8o1_500.gif\" /></p>\n\n<p>After being on roughly the same list for over a year, I dropped the <a href=\"/en/card/08058\">Oaktown Renovation</a> and went to a single <a href=\"/en/card/21057\">Armed Intimidation</a>. While the Oaktown-money is great early game, the agenda is just plain awkward later. Yes, I know you should have won by then, but it happens often enough that you haven't. Armed is less awkward and you can close the game by installing it without advancing and <a href=\"/en/card/12058\">Audacitying</a> it out next turn. And earlier in the game just scoring it without any clicks left is pretty good, as well. The runner loses 5 cards or has to clear two tags, either of which is just tempo.</p>\n\n<p>I did switch back from 2 <a href=\"/en/card/13057\">IPO</a>, 1 <a href=\"/en/card/22056\">Too Big to Fail</a> to the opposite to get just a little more money.</p>\n\n<p>So I saw Slowriffs-deck with 3 Armed Intimidation from Belgian nats and figured it was worth a shot. I do think running 3 <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile Takeovers</a> is correct, so I went with 1 <a href=\"/en/card/09026\">Food</a> and 3 Hostiles over 3 Oaktown. The 3 Hostiles meant I could stay with <a href=\"/en/card/01101\">Archer</a> over <a href=\"/en/card/21118\">Surveyor</a>. Those Archers did save me in one game, so I'm pretty happy with that choice.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/en/card/11094\">IP Blocks</a> are also a copy from Slowriffs as I expected an increase in AI breakers with <a href=\"/en/card/21086\">Laamb</a> banned and <a href=\"/en/card/21108\">Engolo</a> restricted. I didn't get to fire the encounter ability of IP Block once, and didn't see that many AI breakers at all, so I'm not sure this is right. Maybe adding an <a href=\"/en/card/06111\">Excalibur</a> instead might be worth it, but I'm not sure what to cut and I'm already not too happy with running only 2 <a href=\"/en/card/11097\">Mausolus</a>. I feel there may be some improvements in the ice suite.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it was another fantastic well-organised weekend! I had some really tense and fun games over the three days. Also a shoutout to the Enschede-meta.

Sadly I had three very slow starting runner games, each of which meant that I had 5 minutes or less for my Azmari games.\nIn two of my wins I got seriously agenda flooded and I'm rather proud of managing to squeeze out victories.</p>\n", "user_id": 1361, "user_name": "hnautsch", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11060": 3, "11094": 2, "21015": 2, "21034": 2, "21038": 3, "21039": 3, "21054": 1, "21055": 3, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "25082": 1, "25115": 1, "25116": 1, "25139": 1, "25143": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "27006": 2, "28005": 2, "09013": 2, "09014": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57250": {"id": 57250, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T10:39:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T10:39:03+00:00", "name": "Questing for Glory", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14901, "user_name": "Countzer0", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10074": 1, "11060": 2, "11080": 1, "11097": 1, "11112": 3, "12098": 1, "21038": 3, "21072": 2, "21080": 3, "21118": 3, "22052": 1, "22055": 3, "23054": 3, "25079": 1, "25123": 1, "25124": 2, "25127": 1, "25133": 1, "25138": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "26048": 1, "26056": 3, "26058": 1, "26060": 1, "06010": 1, "06111": 1, "07015": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57251": {"id": 57251, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T10:39:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T10:39:03+00:00", "name": "Toolkit Leela", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14901, "user_name": "Countzer0", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10043": 1, "10085": 2, "12105": 1, "21044": 3, "21045": 1, "21047": 1, "21104": 2, "21105": 3, "21106": 2, "22014": 1, "25007": 1, "25010": 2, "25021": 1, "25022": 2, "25026": 1, "25030": 1, "25032": 2, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "25065": 1, "26016": 2, "26018": 2, "26026": 2, "03053": 3, "07032": 2, "09035": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57252": {"id": 57252, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T11:03:36+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-27T21:43:30+00:00", "name": "Broad Day-what? (7-2 at Worlds)", "description": "<p>For a more entertaining meme-based write-up, check out the older version of this deck <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56259/the-power-broker#\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I always liked The Outfit purely for thematic reasons and being the first non-basic ID I owned I\u2019ve been playing it for the last 9 months (almost my entire net runner career). </p>\n\n<p>I took pieces from @5N00P1\u2019s <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/54565/reverse-outfit-1st-berlin-store-champ-\">Reverse Outfit</a> and @Boreira\u2019s <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/54267/rude-deck-8-2-at-berlin-double-play-2019-\">Rude Deck</a> and meshed all together combined with my pet card <a href=\"en/card/22051\">Broad Daylight</a>. \nThis undervalued agenda is a nightmare when scored, being the game equivalent of dropping a knife on the table and asking, \u201cso, what was that you had to say?\u201d. Two of them and you drop a shotgun instead, making you able to score whatever the hell you want. Also makes Punitive and CWP a lot better.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with the card removal package Snare!, City Works Project and Data Loop the deck offers solutions to remote locks so common nowadays. </p>\n\n<p>DRM is an amazing card that feels like having extra atlas counters. Usually I fetch CWP but it can also be Hostile Takeover when you need some credit boost. I used to play RecoCo but it made the deck slower and DRM is much better.</p>\n\n<p>In swiss this deck did great beating 3 Apoc Vals, 1 Reg Val, 1 Smoke, 1 Wu  and 1 Hayley. Losses were to Apoc Val (3 top decks in 4 runs, no apocs landed :/ ), and 1 Smoke. One of the losses happened on the first 2-4-1 of day 2, eliminating me from the tournament. </p>\n\n<p>The MVP\u2019s were definitely Snare! And B-Daylight, which I scored in 6 games, always making my opponents take the card for a look. \u201cBroad Day-what?\u201d, one of them said. Snares gave me legs against one Smoke on Film Critic, putting the runner in a Kobayashi Maru situation, either drawing to survive (Bdaylight scored) or removing the tag. Floating the tag meant I could neutralize all threats and advance my way to win. In one game I escaped the lock by sneaking a Snare behind a Data Loop and getting the sweet kill. </p>\n\n<p>I know 11 is way too many agendas for most decks but here you have to constantly find them and get to 4-5 points as fast as possible. Sometimes the deck will betray you but that\u2019s life. Another fatal blow is Film Critic but honestly,  any Self-Protecting agenda is countered by it, so just live with that. Apocalypse is hard due to the light ICE suite but not unbeatable as one can see by the results. The good match-ups are most Crims, Aesop\u2019s Hayley and Reg Anarchs. Padlock Freedom is a bit tricky but not a great concern. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks NISEI for the amazing tournament, everyone from the Berlin Meta for bringing me up to speed (turns out losing to great players for 8 months builds skills and character) and all the people I\u2019ve met/played against this past weekend.</p>\n\n<p>P.S.: Minutes before the registration I added the second Audacity instead of an NGO or IPO. In one of the games I had the winning Atlas in hand and a counter on another. Val installs Stargate and trashes Audacity. I've never been so happy about a last minute change.</p>\n", "user_id": 32212, "user_name": "Quercia", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 3, "11078": 1, "11097": 2, "12058": 2, "12095": 2, "21078": 2, "21080": 3, "22050": 1, "22051": 3, "22056": 3, "23054": 3, "25079": 1, "25091": 2, "25111": 3, "25124": 3, "25126": 3, "25130": 1, "25133": 2, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 1, "26058": 1, "27006": 2, "06111": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57253": {"id": 57253, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T11:12:36+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-19T02:44:04+00:00", "name": "Recocoutfit (Top ranked Outfit at Worlds 2019)", "description": "\n", "user_id": 2471, "user_name": "Circadia", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 3, "10094": 2, "11016": 2, "11078": 1, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21020": 3, "21036": 1, "21118": 3, "21119": 1, "22050": 1, "22056": 3, "23054": 3, "25079": 3, "25111": 2, "25124": 3, "25125": 1, "25126": 3, "25130": 1, "25146": 3, "26058": 2, "26060": 1, "06111": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57254": {"id": 57254, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T11:29:43+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T11:29:43+00:00", "name": "Percomis NEH", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 25032, "user_name": "MrBuggles", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10018": 3, "10067": 2, "11016": 3, "11080": 1, "11094": 2, "21055": 3, "21074": 1, "21076": 3, "21080": 3, "22058": 1, "25072": 3, "25107": 3, "25108": 3, "25116": 1, "25118": 1, "25143": 2, "26047": 2, "06005": 1, "06088": 2, "06106": 3, "08110": 3, "08118": 3, "09004": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57255": {"id": 57255, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T11:29:43+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T11:29:43+00:00", "name": "FTT Val", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 25032, "user_name": "MrBuggles", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10083": 1, "10085": 2, "11024": 2, "11042": 2, "11047": 3, "11081": 2, "12101": 3, "12104": 3, "21029": 3, "21103": 3, "25007": 3, "25016": 1, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "07030": 1, "07032": 3, "08043": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "57256": {"id": 57256, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T11:38:14+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T11:40:12+00:00", "name": "Fast Food MaxX", "description": "<p>It's a swift wanton MaxX deck, not much to say.</p>\n\n<p>The rejig was cool in a couple of matches, to reset an imp or D4, but was useless most of the time.

For my runner I chose <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56937/compilation-hayley-2-swedish-nationals-winner-mwl-3-3-\">Compilation Hayley</a> due to previous practice and comfort with previous versions of the deck, which made me appreciate the potential of Argus to have very quick games even more.</p>\n\n<p>This list has two changes from the <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55910/yoghurt-fight-50-extra-free-2nd-at-euros-\">'canonically correct' Argus list</a> most recently published, both decided upon by the (much better than me) deckbuilders and Argus players in the UK testing group: </p>\n\n<ul><li>-1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/05027\">Fast Track</a>  +1 <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21119\">High-Profile Target</a></li>\n</ul><p>This change was primarily made because of the prevalence of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a>, meaning losing both your <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21119\">HPTs</a> from R&amp;D was a very possible scenario.

In the Swiss it beat Security Nexus 419, Smoke, Apoc Val, and two Freedom. In the top 16 Cut it beat an Apoc Val and a <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57208/surfing-rainbows-for-value-t16-worlds-2019\">Pelangi/Surfer Hayley</a> (by purging <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08001\">Clot</a> 4 times).

With two DOOF, you can easily punish such nonsense (20% chance of having one of them in you starting hand, 35% if you mull for it), and put them on the back foot. By the time they recover, you have installed Stargate and started to punish them, or grabbed an early agenda.</p>\n\n<p>In CoL it did OK, in the main event, not as well as my stupid corp deck, even if the losses were very close.

anything else I would like to shout out my friend Drenus' Art, who created this awesome Adam art, check him out here: </p>\n\n<p>https://www.instagram.com/drenusart/</p>\n\n<p>https://www.facebook.com/drenusart/</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/toejZJO.jpg\" alt=\"Imgur\" /></p>\n\n<p>Also thanks for everyone at NISEI for keeping the greatest game alive, and the community, for continuing the run. Also thanks for all my opponents it was a pleasure running with you!</p>\n\n<p>Soooooo.</p>\n\n<p>This is the <a href=\"/en/card/09037\">Adam</a> deck I brought to worlds and took 3rd place with. It is definitely my weaker deck, finishing 5-6 (I think) while my <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57292/sports-12-runners-1-3rd-place-worlds-\">corp deck</a> finished 12-1. I'm going to be honest I dont really remember all my matchups the first day, but the second day I lost to ASA (non rococo assetspam), kill Azmari, and won against jinja ASA and the same Azmari on stream. During this 3 days of playing Adam I realized that I made some bad choices with this deck, so lets discuss them:</p>\n\n<p>Lets start with the unicorn in the room: <a href=\"/en/card/08086\">Film Critic</a></p>\n\n<p>In our meta here in Hungary/Czechia there are a lot of good jinteki and argus players, and when <a href=\"/en/card/21108\">Engolo</a> got restricted I didnt even think about throwing FC out. Looking at worlds meta, it also doesnt seem too bad because its good against Argus, Lakshmi, Sportsmetal and IG, but I only faced 1 IG and 1 Lakshmi out of those, and didnt even have time to find my FCs vs them. all-in-all it just didnt feel good and I will switch back to Engolo for the early pressure and try out whistleblower. <a href=\"/en/card/12008\">Mad Dash</a> is also worth mentioning, although <a href=\"/en/card/10045\">\"Freedom Through Equality\"</a> does a very similar thing without a unicorn symbol, so there is that. In hindsight I would definitely change out one more Interdiction for a second FtE in this 3/5 agenda meta</p>\n\n<p>Econ:</p>\n\n<p>I am super happy with my choices here. <a href=\"/en/card/26026\">Rezeki</a> just feels like a better Data folding, being one cheaper and not a resource, and PAD Taps are awesome. I rarely had big money problems, and you dont really need draw besides <a href=\"/en/card/09044\">Safety First</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Breakers:</p>\n\n<p>I already talked about missing Engolo, but I am also not sure about my killer choice. I was on <a href=\"/en/card/26016\">Bukhgalter</a> for a long time and I miss the efficiency of it, but I cant justify the influence cost, and I wasnt too disappointed with <a href=\"/en/card/12088\">Na'Not'K</a> so I'm gonna probably keep it. Also with engolo you can break some stuff cheaper than Na'Not'k, and even if you dont <a href=\"/en/card/21089\">Logic Bomb</a> is there for you.</p>\n\n<p>No recursion:</p>\n\n<p>This was a bad choice. I am not sold on <a href=\"/en/card/03038\">Clone Chip</a>, but playing 1 or 2 <a href=\"/en/card/21107\">Reclaims</a> should be a no brainer. recurring <a href=\"/en/card/21089\">Logic Bombs</a> just seem sick</p>\n\n<p>No <a href=\"/en/card/21029\">RNG Key</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Here is my hottest take of the day probably: <a href=\"/en/card/21029\">RNG Key</a> in Adam sucks. It just makes you play worse for a low to medium benefit. In my opinion the ideal Adam strategy is only run RnD when you see and agenda on top with <a href=\"/en/card/11047\">Find the Truth</a>, and only pressure HQ and remotes. Running RnD just for RNG Key feels like a waste of a click as soon as rnd is iced. Also the 1 memory early is better spent on rezeki</p>\n\n<p>All in all this is a solid Adam list that still has some kinks to work out, it got carried by my corp, but when it mattered, it won me games. I would recommend anyone playing some Adam, I think he is the most fun runner by far.</p>\n\n<p>Continue The Run!</p>\n", "user_id": 24625, "user_name": "ToThBeBe", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10045": 1, "10085": 1, "11085": 1, "11087": 2, "12088": 1, "21028": 3, "21089": 3, "21106": 3, "25007": 3, "25010": 1, "25017": 2, "25054": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "26026": 3, "03053": 3, "08086": 3, "09037": 1, "09039": 3, "09040": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57287": {"id": 57287, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T17:02:59+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T23:14:43+00:00", "name": "Adam Worlds", "description": "\n", "user_id": 33770, "user_name": "anarchomushroom", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10045": 2, "10085": 2, "11085": 1, "11087": 2, "21028": 3, "21089": 3, "21107": 1, "21108": 1, "25007": 3, "25010": 1, "25017": 2, "25022": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "25065": 1, "26016": 1, "03053": 3, "07055": 3, "09037": 1, "09039": 3, "09040": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57288": {"id": 57288, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T17:03:11+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-17T07:07:41+00:00", "name": "Hostile Assets Jinteki (Worlds)", "description": "\n", "user_id": 33770, "user_name": "anarchomushroom", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10050": 3, "10067": 3, "11049": 3, "11060": 1, "11080": 2, "21038": 2, "21051": 3, "21080": 3, "22039": 2, "25072": 3, "25073": 3, "25085": 1, "25087": 2, "25088": 1, "25089": 2, "25092": 3, "25143": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "05007": 3, "06083": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57289": {"id": 57289, "date_creation": "2019-10-08T17:17:46+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-28T04:11:13+00:00", "name": "Have all cakes and eat them too!(5th at Worlds!)", "description": "<p>Joining the mandatory GIF tradition to celebrate :D</p>\n\n<p></p><p><a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/vxO5kskCuNp765PSSO/giphy.gif\">via GIPHY</a></p>\n\n<p>This is the latest and greatest version of my Azmari deck which carried me to 5th place at Worlds, going 8-2 during the tournament (not counting a win by game loss). DonLoverGate already took it to 2nd place at Edinburgh regionals https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57010, but naturally I\u00b4m reposting because hey, I got 5th place at worlds :D</p>\n\n<p>The two games I lost were in the top cut, one against Pinsel on Khumalo, and one against Tothbebes Adam deck where I got steamrolled after making a very bad play that left my servers open, it would probably have been a very tough game anyway, but would have loved to see how it could have gone.</p>\n\n<p>I took the previous version to 2nd place at Malm\u00f6 regionals and DonLoverGate won Vienna regionals with it: https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56487 \nThe only difference is that this one plays an enigma instead of the Archangel.</p>\n\n<p>The deck name comes from the many perks that I think come with this deck, the strong but cheap ice suite, the tag punishment, the econ denial, the econ assets, and only having to put 6 agendas in the deck. One of the main ideas was to use as few deck slots as possible for tag punishment and agendas.</p>\n\n<p>The game plan is to slow down the runner directly through Scarcity of Resources and the threat of HHN + economic warfare, and indirectly through the ID ability, while you gain money from daily quests, rashidas, reinforce your servers and score agendas. Over time you can build a taxing remote if needed by stacking your surveyors there. Even if the runner gets in, the follow up of HHN can lead to a kill or a scoring window if they clear the tags. </p>\n\n<p>The 3-point only agenda suite forces the runner to steal half the agendas in your deck to win, unless they have notoriety, mad dash or freedom through equality. Also only half of your agendas are stealable at the start of the game (unless you are facing Adam ;() which means that you often can leave your centrals wide open early on, the most devestating turn one is usually to play scarcity and then install and rez a daily quest with ice in front. </p>\n\n<p>Consulting visit is great as it can be used both to get scarcity early, effectively giving you 5 scarcitys, but also it makes the threat of BOOM and HHN more reliable. Getting Economic warfare with it is great too sometimes to make HHN more potent. You can even in a pinch use it for preemptive action or archived memories.</p>\n\n<p>Archived memories is an amazing use of 2 influence. Get your scarcity back, get your kill back, get your tags back, get your rashidas back, get your daylies back, get your echo chamber back to threaten the win.</p>\n\n<p>I went with this deck both because I have a lot of practice with it, but also because I felt like it doesnt have any matchups where I feel uncomfortable, except maybe against Adam(damn you Tothbebe :D) because of his ability to steal degree mills early, the freedom through equality, find the truth to spot for the rare agendas, logic bombs to get into the remote and misdirection to deal with HHN. </p>\n\n<p>During swiss this deck took down Hailey, Two Alices, Rustryders apoc val, Pinsels Khumalo and another one, and a Liza(Turn 3 BOOM :D). During the first round of the top cut I was also able to beat barely Tothbebes Adam deck with a little luck.</p>\n\n<p>The most hilarious play of the event to me was when I at 6 points double advanced a naked degree mill against an apoc alice with 0 credits and one face down card installed.

But still, with this much of a deficit the Metals need the <a href=\"/en/card/06010\">mother</a> of all comebacks to have any chance in the game.</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/07IKNFW.jpg\" alt=\"Get ready\" /></p>\n\n<p>But look at that! A <a href=\"/en/card/22031\">Fast Break</a>! Thats exactly what <a href=\"/en/card/22049\">Arella</a> and her team needed! This could be a <a href=\"/en/card/22032\">Game Changer</a>!

If they run it, good you get closer to comboing out with \n<a href=\"/en/card/22031\">Fast Breaks</a>. If they dont, score them for 1. If youre on 5 or 6 points they will have to run them.

Also the ice suite can just shut out people without AI breakers, and vs Aumakua just toss the cvs into the bin, dont install assets and upgrades and purge once.

This is especially useful against the asset spam decks with hate against apoc where you might need a backup plan. </p>\n\n<p>The card is not useless against other corps though, getting the bad pub makes it easier to run the remote repeatedly, makes the apoc turn cheaper, and lets you break things cheaply post apoc. If they chose to lose 5 then that is also pretty great.

Originally, I had planned to take it to CoL and take a more standard and serious Argus list for the main event, but I ended up doing the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m a fairly recent player, so I thought that if I wanted to win a few matches I needed to surprise people a bit. Especially with Argus, which has been explored and played to death by a lot of much better players than me, who know exactly how to play it and how to play against it. Now, I thought the latest MWL changes would be interesting for Weyland because of the Laamb removal: all of a sudden, Str 8 multi sub barriers could not be broken for 5 anymore. So a Glacier plan could make a good sense. And with Laamb removed and Engolo restricted, there would be a lot of turtle-based and brahman based decks. So\u2026 Why not go full Chiyashi ?</p>\n\n<p>So the base plan of the deck is really to bet on an embarrassing misunderstanding: your opponent will respect the HHNs and tag punishment you don\u2019t have in your deck, and on your side you are building a big glacier and scoring naked agendas if you are flooded (only 8 agendas in the deck, but it can happen). You start by icing up centrals and quickly put ICE on the remote, let stew a few agendas masquerading as prisec or such, bait a run by IAA a bio dome and generally strangle them slowly. </p>\n\n<p>Building blocks is awesome in the deck, as it helps you build up the remote, pump the strength of the Surveyors and rez really expensive ICE like Bulwark and Chiyashi (5 targets in all in the deck). Bio vaults are there to make them lose time and money and wear their resources out (stimhacks, Lady tokens, Kati money, whatever). Thimbelrig is also awesome as you can switch a second or third rezzzed Chiyashi from R&amp;D or HQ to the remote when you want to score.</p>\n\n<p>Questionable choices: the breached dome is probably not the most optimal choice, and could be a second thimblerig or a reversed accounts, I feel. The deck is also probably missing an Under the Bus or maybe a sea source (Ganelon, you were right!) to get rid of film critics, loaded Kati Jones, etc. Bio vault is nice but a bit too slow.

Since we had to make a decision on ID's before the tournament we quickly decided that I would be playing Anarch and HB and since i already got MaxX and Valencia as lasered ID's, I went for Freedom Khumalo. A quick research on nrdb found <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56760/combination-lock-freedom-1st-at-bristol-regional\" title=\"Dyerlist\">the Dyer List</a> ( shoutout to jamesgrey who made the original version ) that had a strong core but in my mind had issues setting up properly. So i just cut every card that was not important for the game plan and juggled a little bit with the remaining cards cutting <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/21068\">Consume</a> and even <a href=\"/en/card/21002\">Yusuf</a> but ended up putting them back in and just go down to the most powerful events so that 3 <a href=\"/en/card/08062\">Street Peddlers</a> could be justified.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly we spent a lot of time testing other stuff so this deck was left on the bench until Crown of Lasers. So I was totally unprepared and the list was pretty much untested.</p>\n\n<p>In the 5 rounds of Crown of Lasers Swiss I did not drop a single game, carrying my team with a 9-1 run to a convincing victory of the whole tournament. While there were lucky draws involved for sure, taking over games eventually and trashing cards left and right felt amazing and reminded me of the old Noise. </p>\n\n<p>Some stuff i figured out on friday evening:</p>\n\n<ol><li><p>Most importantly, the combo of <a href=\"/en/card/21062\">Knobkierie</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/02003\">Imp</a> was already strong in <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/50634/the-colours-of-disease-11th-12th-euros-2018\" title=\"The Colors Of Disease\">Colors of Disease</a> back at Euros 2018 and in Khumalo it is much more natural. <a href=\"/en/card/02003\">Imp</a> can handle so many problems that other cards can't while also being a pressure tool for HQ and R&amp;D (see Colors of Disease description).</p></li>\n<li><p>You don't need many viruses in Khumalo. <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/02003\">Imp</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/21002\">Yusuf</a> already create enough pressure and there are a lot of 0 costs card, that you trash with Khumalo without even having a virus installed. <a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/21002\">Yusuf</a> are excellent together though, since they break ICE for so cheap and are never running out with the help of <a href=\"/en/card/21062\">Knobkierie</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/21068\">Consume</a> is your lategame economy if you need it and it does very well at that. If you manage to use <a href=\"/en/card/21062\">Knobkierie</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/02003\">Imp</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/21081\">Freedom Khumalo: Crypto-Anarchist</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/21103\">Hippo</a> in a single turn it gives you insane amount of value.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/26025\">Pelangi</a> speeds up your setup, since you need less breakers to be able to run. It also nicely deals with Excalibur which would be quite the problem for a lategame deck like this.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/26004\">Stargate</a> is amazing to finish games and control corp draws. It is probably the stronges pseudo multiaccess card in the game right now competing with <a href=\"/en/card/10085\">The Turning Wheel</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"/en/card/08062\">Street Peddler</a> is more important than I thought, since it synergizes with everything you want to do. You want to get to your set up as quickly as possible and you don't want to spend money and time to do it. It also has good synergy with <a href=\"/en/card/01004\">Stimhack</a> and the heap breakers.</p></li>\n</ol><p>At first I thought that I was just somewhat lucky, but people kept asking me about the Khumalo deck that did so well. So I told them what I experienced and my two teammates from CoL,@percomis and @terrificy picked it up as well for Worlds.</p>\n\n<p>While I did not do so well with the deck in the main event, Pinsel and testrunning overperformed. Probably because of their profound experience with Noise it just felt natural to adapt a similar playstyle. I am very happy and proud of both of them doing so well. Congratulations and very well played!</p>\n", "user_id": 5521, "user_name": "JackMade", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11024": 2, "11042": 2, "11081": 1, "21002": 2, "21062": 2, "21068": 1, "21081": 1, "21103": 3, "25007": 3, "25013": 1, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 1, "26025": 1, "03038": 2, "03046": 1, "03053": 3, "06033": 2, "06073": 3, "07032": 3, "08062": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57206": {"id": 57206, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T03:19:56+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-25T00:00:59+00:00", "name": "Fully dedicated to efficiency! - 1st at 2019 NISEI Worlds", "description": "<p>This is my Asa deck with which i won worlds 2019. It is a tempo deck that has different ways to score 7 points, usually by finishing with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21020\">reconstruction contract</a>+ <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10017\">dedication ceremony</a> for <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25068\">vitruvius</a> counter and a <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09026\">food</a> later. However, it also has other strong ways to score agendas depending on what you draw.</p>\n\n<p>The heart of the deck is the ridiculously efficient econ engine of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/find/?q=rashida\">rashida</a>/<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11111\">VLC</a>/<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26036\">fully operational</a>. This allows you to outpace any runner. On top of that, Asa basically gives you 4 click turns (5 with <s>beth</s> <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10067\">jeeves</a>) and hedgefund is there to complement it with some reliable credits.</p>\n\n<p>What makes the deck hard to deal is that you can/want to ICE your assets. This makes it very hard for a runner to contest assets, because it is not enough to just have asset hate like <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/03045\">paricia</a>, you also need to be able to beat ICE to actually use it. Because all ICE except <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10095\">vanilla</a> is painful to facecheck, this allows you to also never advance agendas. The runner has to be careful which remotes he runs, because you don't want to waste clicks/tools breaking ICE just to find another asset that is also expensive to trash. As a bonus, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06079\">astrolabe</a> doesn't give much cards due to ICEing your remotes and in principle, you don't need any board to win.</p>\n\n<p>My package to then score out and win is fast advance and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/10028\">lakshmi</a>. The reconstruction contract and lakshmi pair well with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06088\">executive bootcamp</a>, giving you effectivly 3 copies of each to find depending on the situation and being excellent <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09030\">apoc</a>/<a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08103\">ddos</a> tech. It is also very hard for a runner to include both lakshmi hate and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08001\">clot</a>! And you can deal with clot by purging with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/03005\">effcomm</a> counters, or <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/07027\">CVS</a>, which can be conveniently installed during a score with an Asa trigger. At last, because the deck is so fast and gets money quickly, it can also rush out a few points early by using multiple ICE. With Asa, you can turn an empty remote into a scoring remote by installing the agenda, getting a second ICE and still have 2 clicks left to pressure the runner in another way. This is very potent against anarchs and crims.</p>\n\n<p>Even though the agenda suite is designed to be used for reconstruction contract fast advance, vitruvius and efficiency committee's counters are also both very strong to just make value plays. An example would be to install a card against <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21063\">419</a> with <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12104\">turtle</a>, take a click with effcomm, purge with jeeves, and then do stuff. It is like a three click turn, but you also reset turtle. Or just play more fully operational with vitruvius counters.</p>\n\n<p>What i really like about this deck that is is very flexible and allows you to do a lot of different plays. But this also makes it hard to play, because seeing the best line in a given situation can be quite hard. Misusing agenda counters can be backbreaking.</p>\n\n<p>In preparation of worlds, i refined my inital list and threw out cute cards like <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21069\">malia</a> for <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08086\">film critic</a> or <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08110\">team sponsorship</a>. The last last minute change i made and which was great was cutting some lakshmi and team sponsorships for <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25146\">hedgefunds</a>, which is a good card. Who could have known that! In the end i ended up with this list which only plays one true one-of. Some cuts had to be made, but basically almost every card is a playset, which i think is very neat.</p>\n\n<p>I had a blast playing at worlds this year, and asa carried me hard. In the end it lost twice, once in swiss and in the winner bracket final after 12 games. Both losses were against freedom and a little bit unlucky, but they were still both great games.</p>\n\n<p>The other matches were against apoc anarchs, 419 and hayley. 419 couldn't deny enough economy or contest assests. Hayley usually couldn't beat lakshmi, and was struggling to contest the board and keep the clot threat alive. Apoc anarchs were quite hard and i actually lost my entire board 3 times. But in the end, apoc did nothing against eff comm counters and i fast advanced to victory.</p>\n\n<p>At last, i want to thank NISEI for an amazing event and keeping the game alive.</p>\n", "user_id": 7514, "user_name": "Pinsel", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 2, "10028": 1, "10067": 3, "10095": 3, "11111": 3, "21009": 1, "21020": 1, "21080": 3, "22029": 3, "25068": 3, "25079": 2, "25080": 2, "25146": 3, "26035": 2, "26036": 3, "03005": 3, "06061": 3, "06088": 2, "07027": 1, "08109": 3, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57207": {"id": 57207, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T06:06:51+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-15T07:36:17+00:00", "name": "Money Ag - T16 Worlds 2019", "description": "<p>This deck went 4-1 in Swiss (4x id) and 1-1 in the cut [playing Ag is a surprisingly great motivation for opponents to agree to an id].</p>\n\n<p>It can both rush or turtle (see round 6 stream for a demonstration of the latter).

I only played one game in the top cut (because I got a gameloss, something with failing to properly write a decklist :D) which I lost due to terrible draw.</p>\n\n<p>Because I did not have any time to test or practice, I decided to throw together all corp and runner cards I might end up playing, and bring them all to Rotterdam. When we arrived at the hotel I noticed I forgot one of my boxes, leaving me without any corpcards. Luckily Wausser brought his entire collection and was nice enough to let me build my deck for CoL. After the first day I was very tired and didn't feel like building a new deck, so I just picked up my decklist from the tournament HQ and handed it in the next day (always check your decklists people!).</p>\n\n<p>This deck was made to cheese my way through swiss, by surprising people with a strange kill. <a href=\"/en/card/05015\">Mushin</a> is amazing. You can either kill by <a href=\"/en/card/12074\">Reeducation</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/25101\">Neural</a>/<a href=\"/en/card/11099\">Show of Force</a> or any other combination or damagecards. Sometimes you can kill unsuspecting runners with <a href=\"/en/card/25089\">Junebugs</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/05010\">Psychic Fields</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/25101\">Neural EMPs</a>. If they decide to go tag me you can win by <a href=\"/en/card/25118\">Psycho'ing</a> out <a href=\"/en/card/12074\">Reeducation</a>. I noticed the <a href=\"/en/card/10095\">Vanilla's</a> should probably be <a href=\"/en/card/09015\">Resistors</a> to help if the runner goes tag me. The meme <a href=\"/en/card/25109\">Ghost Branches</a> should probably be <a href=\"/en/card/25117\">Closed Accounts</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I am having the most fun at a tournament when I am playing with a deck that I have made myself. There is a lot of value in playing something people don't expect, because of the secretive nature of the corp. If you don't like stuff like this, well, keep on trying with a list the runner knows card by card ;)</p>\n\n<p>This was my first Worlds and it was great! I have met a lot of new people and had a great time!</p>\n", "user_id": 10840, "user_name": "Wet Toastie", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10095": 3, "11016": 3, "11080": 2, "11099": 3, "12074": 3, "21039": 3, "21055": 1, "21080": 3, "25089": 3, "25101": 3, "25106": 1, "25109": 2, "25112": 3, "25118": 2, "25146": 3, "28004": 3, "05010": 2, "05015": 3, "06005": 1, "09009": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57216": {"id": 57216, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T14:40:59+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-25T00:03:46+00:00", "name": "2 Grid for 2 Place (2nd at Worlds 2019 and 1st at CoL)", "description": "<p><img data-src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TkoXHzr.gif\" alt=\"Alt Text\" /></p>\n\n<p>So this deck can take you to a second place at worlds, but only if you were on the way to make first. Other than that it is just a standard good stuff palana. Although if you want, you can make some interesting plays - like accidentally installing two LaCosta Grids to get a game loss in the grand finals which lets you nicely skip a game, you would lose anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Well, anyways, I played this deck at Crown of Lasers and Worlds and did fairly well with it. At CoL I played two <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/26040\">Yagis-Udas</a> instead of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21038\">SSL</a> and <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/07027\">CVS</a>, which were some last minutes changes. SSL was good and reduced the agenda density. CVS felt good as well, though I think it was not a good tech card as it only improved the already really good crim match up. Cutting it and an IP Block for Crisium and another cheap ice like a third thimblerig would have probably helped more with the rough Anarch match up.</p>\n\n<p>So the only loss against <strong>Crim</strong> was the first match in CoL against @Wet Toastie, were I just did not yet know how to play this deck (ice up centrals against crim, purge and have plenty of time to win before they find all their breakers and enough money). </p>\n\n<p>Against <strong>Anarch</strong> on the other hand I lost thrice (twice with apoc), though that might be skewed as these were some of the best players I faced.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shaper</strong> is an interesting match up about outpacing each other. Your late game plan is to have two Etr Effects as they can only break Excalibur with Pelangi once. Here I had only one loss as well but I faced them less than Crim.</p>\n\n<p>Cards choices: </p>\n\n<ol><li><p><a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/27005\">La Costa</a> is actually a really good card, which lets you never advance Niseis but more importantly just saves you clicks. So you can just stick NGOs and Biovaults in the remote while you draw for your Niseis or do more stuff the turn before or after scoring.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11060\">Scarcity</a> was really good as well. Some games I played it turn one and it stayed the whole game. This just cripples so many runner econs giving you the time to score out. Apoc is not scary if the runner has no money.</p></li>\n<li><p>I did not play <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11080\">Preemptive</a>. It does nothing to make your deck faster, which is your game plan. Might be cute against Stargate, but scoring out fast is good against that as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ice is just value cheap ice with a few big ones if you have too much money.</p></li>\n</ol><p>Last but not least shoutout to @Pinsel who gave me the original list and won the finals (well deserved as his asa deck is just the better deck, which I could not have played myself; at least not nearly as well). Shout out as well to @JackMade who carried all three of us to a win at CoL and whose <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/57205/trash-panda-1st-at-col-1st-2nd-at-worlds-2019\">Freedom deck</a> carried me through worlds. Also to the whole NWE team for decktesting, tips and moral support and the Nisei team for the amazing event and keeping the game alive.</p>\n", "user_id": 15130, "user_name": "Testrunning", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10030": 1, "11053": 1, "11060": 3, "11094": 3, "12070": 3, "21038": 1, "21039": 3, "21051": 3, "21072": 3, "21080": 3, "22039": 2, "25087": 3, "25088": 1, "25100": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "27005": 3, "28004": 3, "28005": 3, "06111": 2, "07027": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57217": {"id": 57217, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T16:16:53+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-07T16:16:53+00:00", "name": "All Guarantees Null and Void (33rd, Worlds 2019)", "description": "\n", "user_id": 8397, "user_name": "RJorb", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11016": 3, "11040": 3, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21036": 3, "21039": 2, "21057": 1, "21080": 3, "21118": 2, "21119": 2, "22056": 2, "23054": 3, "25112": 3, "25124": 3, "25126": 3, "25133": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "26058": 1, "07001": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57218": {"id": 57218, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T16:17:28+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-07T16:17:28+00:00", "name": "Valpocalypse (33rd, Worlds 2019)", "description": "\n", "user_id": 8397, "user_name": "RJorb", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10083": 1, "11008": 1, "11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11081": 3, "25006": 1, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "26004": 3, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "06100": 1, "07030": 1, "07031": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 3, "08021": 3, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57219": {"id": 57219, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T16:23:22+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-07T16:23:22+00:00", "name": "Fake news", "description": "\n", "user_id": 10372, "user_name": "Thor Madsen", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10083": 1, "10085": 3, "11024": 1, "11042": 1, "11081": 1, "12101": 3, "12104": 1, "21103": 3, "25007": 1, "25013": 2, "25016": 3, "25017": 2, "25019": 3, "25048": 2, "25050": 1, "25059": 3, "03046": 2, "03053": 3, "07030": 1, "07031": 2, "07032": 3, "07033": 3, "07037": 1, "07047": 2, "07049": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57220": {"id": 57220, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T17:11:53+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-19T12:14:06+00:00", "name": "Earth's last, best mom (8-4 at Worlds)", "description": "<h2>\"So this deck mostly just makes cards and draws money?\"</h2>\n\n<h2>\"Wait, this boosts till the end of the run??\"</h2>\n\n<h2>\"MAD DASH????\"</h2>\n\n<p>^ My opponents last weekend</p>\n\n<p>This was the deck I played during both COL and the Worlds main event. I was the only Sunny player at the big show on Saturday, with even Apex (!) being played by 2 brave souls. Outside of one Adam player though, I was actually the second highest ranked mini faction player.</p>\n\n<p>The deck performed pretty well, winning 8 games vs 4 Palana's, Argus, ASA, Azmari and Sportsmetal. It lost vs tempo NEH, Spark Agency, Sportsmetal and Blue Sun. I did horrible with my corp decks though, both due to lack of practice and a bit of bad luck in a few games.</p>\n\n<p>I have talked about this deck often already, so lemme just go over some notable changes for Worlds.</p>\n\n<h2>Mad Dash as unicorn</h2>\n\n<p>I haven't been super impressed by Power Tap. Sure, it can make you cash, but unless you are playing against NBN, this will probably only trigger once per turn via Nexus. Other support cards to trigger it are too slow. Film Critic is alround good and obviously I would never tell you to not run it (especially since there are copies with my face going around). But Sunny doesn't really require it as much as other runners. This deck is immune to Punitive, can deal with Obokata behind a Data Loop and benefits from SSL steals via Pad Tap.</p>\n\n<p>I was about to settle on no Unicorn when I figured, \"might as well try Mad Dash, sinced it has no influence pips\". Turns out it was pretty good. It makes Sunny's Black Hat a lot better, especially since it combos with Turning Wheel. Farm counters, trace the corp, and then Mad Dash into R&amp;D like a mad woman. 90% of the time it works every time.</p>\n\n<h2>No Data Folding</h2>\n\n<p>Corps are very rushy these days and while this is one of the faster Sunny's, I still sometimes loose cause the corp can just score out before I can confidently contest. I figured the Data Folding were one of the weakest parts of the decks if the games were gonna go fast. So I cut them in favor for more immediate cash. If the game lasts a while, you might have trouble making money reliably, but normally either you or the corp will have won before then. You can always add one Kati, for insurance. The one of Rezeki is there for SDS Drone Deployment.</p>\n\n<h2>Liberated Accounts</h2>\n\n<p>I needed more Career Fair targets and fast dollars, and this card provided that. </p>\n\n<h2>No Interdiction</h2>\n\n<p>I figured with 14 resources, I wouldnt be as susceptible to Scarcity as I usually am, so I cut the 2 copies of Interdiction. Besides, I hadn't seen Scarcity in ages. But the Worlds meta was full of it, and that bit me in the ass a bit. Definitely worth a slot again.</p>\n\n<h2>Office Supplies</h2>\n\n<p>Bumped up to 3 after Belgian Nats. Better than I expected, specially if you get a Sports Hopper out early.

It went 4-1 at CoL and 7-0 at Worlds.</p>\n\n<p>I agonised long and hard over which restricted card to retain, and in most of the run up to Worlds thought I'd likely retain Corporate Grant, which plays so well into the general plan of slowing the Corp down and avoids problems with Scarcity. In testing the deck felt a little slow, and myself and some of the other 419 players decided to cut a few tech cards and add in more goodstuff. The deck previously played No one home and Citadel in the Gagarin meta, but with that threat gone it seemed unecessary to play both. I also cut the Same Old Thing I previously had in the list to add Earthrise Hotel. I decided to try an Engolo version in CoL and see how it felt, and it performed well enough that I took it to the main event. I basically swapped the 3 Corporate Grants for 3 econ cards, and the deck felt very smooth, though it was partly good luck in facing zero Scarcity all day. Engolo provides a better matchup against rushy Weyland lists out of Argus and the Outfit, and makes it harder for Jinteki to cheese out agendas against you with Excalibur, though this did happen to me in the only game I lost, where I foolishly overwrote my Turtle to install my full rig. My CoL list had one copy of Government Investigations (!) mainly to have a counter-current and improve the odds against Batty in my most feared matchup, but Wilfy talked me out of such nonsense. </p>\n\n<p>The deck did not have the same matchup more than once in the main event, beating NEH, Argus, The Outfit, Blue Sun, ASA, Biotech and RP. In general it's a pretty rounded deck and flexible enough that it can tech against different things depending on your meta - No one home, Miss Bones, Inside Job and Hernando Cortez were all cards that I tested. The only real matchup I dislike is Blue Sun, especially if playing Batty, which can roll you on a good draw while still posing problems on an average one. I included Amina so that I had a semi backup for any single breaker that was lost, but if that's considered unecessary than any of the tech cards above, or another economy card work fine too. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Nisei for a well run tournament!</p>\n", "user_id": 6051, "user_name": "RotomAppliance", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11008": 3, "11070": 1, "12104": 3, "12105": 1, "21063": 1, "21064": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "21108": 1, "25007": 2, "25010": 1, "25022": 2, "25030": 1, "25032": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "25065": 1, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "26026": 1, "03053": 2, "09035": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57227": {"id": 57227, "date_creation": "2019-10-07T23:04:34+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-13T03:10:48+00:00", "name": "Battyshop - 7th at Nisei Worlds, 6th at CoL", "description": "<p>This is very similar to the Blue Sun list I took to Derby.

PAD Tap is for the most part annoying for the corp costs tempo. DDoS and Inside Job is the combo that is going to rip apart the Corps board state after the first agenda score. After that efficient breakers (you don't really care about Tycoon giving money to the corp with PAD Taps and Beth) and OMG Aumakua triggers with each separate Gang Sign Access!</p>\n\n<p>Some plays. Try to play Fisk Investment on Scoring Rounds or after them. Double up with DDoS Inside job after they end up with 5 cards in HQ or after scoring (for example into HQ) Initially sit back and set up but there are games that you will need to go aggressive with runs especially if you manage to load Aumakua pretty early in the game.

Cayambe is there to sure things up if the game goes longer than you want it to. </p>\n\n<p>I don't remember all these games that well, but I'll try and get the important bits in!</p>\n\n<p>My aim for Stevenage was winning one game with each runner and corp ID, and I lost my first runner game so I wasn't feeling so great going into my first SSO. </p>\n\n<p>Game one: I was against Leela, who's really scary and made me change plans a bit. I had a medium start, ice and money cards, so I did that. I managed to score an early Hostile and not get Diversioned by installing the Hostile and leaving it a turn. My ice placement was also not the best early, and the Leela bounce allowed me to put a Border Control on HQ. \nI got to 4 points, then an Engolo came down. My 3-ice remote was three Code Gates, so the game was turning against me, but thankfully I managed to draw the Biotic and Biotic + Red Planet Couriers out for the win! I did not rez... any ice this game? I may be forgetting, but I don't think I did. Leela never contested the remote, and maybe only ran centrals a couple of times at most? When I didn't have money to rez.</p>\n\n<p>Second game was... a Shaper... Jes! (How could I forget that?) I don't remember the start, but I managed to get an early 3-pointer and started SSOing. They stole 3-points, so it's 3-3. I scored a Hostile, then mandatory drew a 3-pointer at the perfect time to Biotic + Red Planet. I forgot about Clot threat, but thankfully they didn't have it! I don't think I rezzed any ice this game. I don\u2019t remember a lot about this game? It was quick.</p>\n\n<p>Third game was Leela again! A different Leela. Kinda slow, playing Gang Sign and the Supplier. I remember this one better, because I mulliganed a hand of 7 points and two operations for seven points and two operations. Thankfully, first mandatory was a Mausolus, so I installed a City Works, installed Mausolus over it and gained a credit. Either they didn\u2019t run, or they missed on R&amp;D, I can\u2019t remember. They didn\u2019t run HQ. I managed to score it, then scored a Hostile a couple of turns later, forgetting Leela's bounce :( but survived! No Diversion. I got a remote of 2 ice built, with Hortum and Wormhole advanced (Wormhole on the outside - not ideal, but it worked out!). They had Aumakua and were running R&amp;D and HQ a lot and missing, thankfully. I couldn\u2019t afford to rez ice early. On 4 points, I install and single advance a City Works. They Inside Job it, with a fracter, killer and Aumakua installed. I rez Wormhole, with no other ice rezzed, but it takes the Inside Job bypass, and then I rez Hortum! It gives me the money back so I can Biotic + quadruple advance next turn, and I grab two cards from R&amp;D I don\u2019t need, as I already have the Biotic. They then ran R&amp;D, and stole a Hollywood, but they ran the remote first, so all the ice was rezzed and the Inside Job was gone. They bounce other R&amp;D ice. At some point, a Border Control on HQ and Masvingo on R&amp;D were rezzed. I may have rezzed ice in one other game, but I didn\u2019t rez more than 5 all day. Ooh, there was a Maw in this game. I got a bit lucky with Maw hits, and we forgot a Maw trigger on the R&amp;D steal that could have hit the Biotic on a 1 in 5, but I don\u2019t think they could have got into the remote and I had Punitive in hand as a follow up to the 6-damage from City Works, so I think I had it either way? </p>\n\n<p>Game four was 419. SSO is the best corp against 419, at least for me. I lose horribly every time, but I won this game 7-0 in quick time! Face-up agendas and Rashida don\u2019t really care too much about 419\u2019s ability, and they seemed unsure what to do, as their credit denial plan was weak against a deck that can rez big ice for free and bounce back from low credits with Mass Commercialization! I had a great start, got to three points, but they were building an impressive board. They ran my remote and cleared out the Cayambe and a Rashida while I couldn\u2019t rez ice. I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to win if I didn\u2019t close soon, but thankfully, another Rashida drew me a Hostile and a City Works Project! I scored the Hostile, then, next turn, Biotic + Red Planeted for the win! They installed a Kati the turn before I won. That combo really comes out of nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>Most important cards: </p>\n\n<p>All the agendas. They are perfect. Hollywood would be better as a \u2018may\u2019, as you really don\u2019t want to place counters on ice before SSO fires, but there isn\u2019t another face-up 3-pointer. </p>\n\n<p>Rashida. We all know how great Rashida is. Drawing cards is soo important in a deck that wants to go really fast.</p>\n\n<p>Biotic Labor + Red Planet. This combo won me \u00be of my games, and one of those, the first, I don\u2019t think I had much chance of winning without it. It\u2019s annoying, but useless early unless you want to detooth your ice and start over. I like it!</p>\n\n<p>Mass Commercialization and Too Big to Fail. Being able to bounce up from low credits is soo important. The Biotic + Red Planet combo is expensive. You can frequently play Mass Comms for 10+ credits. </p>\n\n<p>Archived Memories. Just as a follow on from the above, a fourth Mass Comms in desperation for 10+ credits can get you back up and running. Also, if key operations like Biotic or Red Planet get trashed. It\u2019s Archived Memories\u2026 it\u2019s just good.</p>\n\n<p>Hortum, Mausolus, Asteroid Belt, Wormhole. These ice turn on with SSO\u2019s ability and allow you to rez strong and powerful ice for cheap/free with your first five credits. Wormhole is blank early, but as soon as you get another End the Run rezzed, it\u2019s so tough for any breaker to deal with not named Engolo. </p>\n\n<p>Border Control. Of course.</p>\n\n<p>Cyberdex Virus Suite. It only played a role in one game, but taking a full turn purging Aumakua is the worst thing for an SSO that wants to go fast. Purging when they accessed on HQ made the remote safe for several turns, and when it\u2019s in archives, it means they have to spend money charging it back up again and not just running Archives.</p>\n\n<p>Other cards:</p>\n\n<p>DRM! I only saw this once all day. It was late in a game when I had six points in hand, so did nothing, but cutting it would be a huge mistake. I had a weird, agenda-heavy day of draw, so I almost always had an agenda when I wanted one, but if you don\u2019t get an agenda in the first three turns, you fall so far behind. </p>\n\n<p>Dedication Ceremony. I never played one all day, but it\u2019s combination with City Works to make one almost unstealable, or set-up the Punitive, I think is too strong to cut. </p>\n\n<p>Cayambe Grid. As I said, this is not a Cayambe deck, so I\u2019m not surprised it didn\u2019t do much, but it\u2019s definitely good as a 1x. </p>\n\n<p>Special Report. This is a holdover from the singular change I made to Alexis\u2019 original deck. It was good for resetting your hand and getting a 3-pointer when you desperately needed one, or scrambling for Punitive, but with DRM now, I\u2019m doubtful it\u2019s good enough. It didn\u2019t come up, so I\u2019m no closer to answering that question, really. The deck is an influence short anyway, so the 3 influence could maybe be better put elsewhere, but I have no idea where. </p>\n\n<p>Guard. Okay, so this is going to be the biggest eyebrow-raiser, and it\u2019s maybe partly there because I love it, but sentries in SSO are a really weak point, and an early End the Run sentry that is immune to bypass feels like it deserves a place over Nebula, which isn\u2019t really good early or late game? It is a 1x so it\u2019s a real gamble as to whether or not you find it early, and it doesn\u2019t hurt like Hortum or Mausolus, but I still think it has a place.</p>\n\n<p>So ice was the thing I didn\u2019t learn much about here. As I said, I only rezzed about five ice all day. It\u2019s possible some numbers are wrong. 1 Ice Wall and 2 Masvingo could be swapped, maybe it should be 3x Mausolus or Asteroid Belt, and the Guard will be a popular candidate for being cut (damn you!). This deck also used to have Crisium, but I think Cayambe and Cyberdex are stronger. But I definitely would not recommend messing with the core of this deck. </p>\n\n<p>This deck is soo much fun! I love SSO, and this is the best SSO I\u2019ve ever played (again, 99% down to Alexis and the Slack community). If I\u2019d have played any other corp, I\u2019d have struggled to win a single game. I also think SSO in general is really strong at the minute. Maybe not the strongest, but people really are unsure how to play against it, or how next turn is going to look. </p>\n\n<p>Please, take it and have fun!  </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>*Update 5/10/19 - Thank you all for making this deck decklist of the week!!! My first ever one. This is amazing! I haven't really played much more since, just a couple of JNet games, but a friend suggested the Special Report could become a second Archived Memories and I like that suggestion! At least unless someone else has any other suggestions? Thank you all again! x\n*Update 6/10/19 - So it seems really apparent this deck doesn't work well when played more like a traditional corp, so I just want to add an extra bit that may help, and just say almost whenever I have a choice between suring up centrals or really anything, and getting a 3-pointer going/protecting it further in a remote, I'll choose the agenda play. You want to do anything to get to 4 points as quickly as possible (whilst also protecting from Diversion and such, of course).</p>\n", "user_id": 30882, "user_name": "I Am Jessica", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 2, "11035": 1, "11097": 2, "12059": 2, "12080": 3, "21077": 1, "21078": 3, "21080": 3, "21099": 2, "21118": 2, "22056": 1, "23054": 3, "25079": 1, "25080": 2, "25124": 2, "25133": 3, "25134": 1, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "27006": 2, "27007": 1, "05024": 1, "07012": 2, "07013": 1, "07027": 1, "08098": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57148": {"id": 57148, "date_creation": "2019-09-29T15:41:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-29T15:59:47+00:00", "name": "Eternal CTM ", "description": "\n", "user_id": 28650, "user_name": "ayyyliens", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10053": 3, "10054": 3, "10074": 1, "10076": 2, "10092": 2, "11016": 3, "11017": 1, "11058": 1, "11094": 3, "21080": 2, "25107": 3, "25112": 2, "25115": 1, "25117": 1, "25146": 3, "28004": 1, "01081": 1, "01082": 3, "01092": 2, "04015": 3, "04076": 3, "09015": 2, "09018": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "57149": {"id": 57149, "date_creation": "2019-09-29T15:41:19+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-29T15:59:44+00:00", "name": "Eternal Hayley", "description": "\n", "user_id": 28650, "user_name": "ayyyliens", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 1, "11024": 1, "11030": 1, "11085": 1, "12008": 1, "12088": 1, "13020": 1, "20039": 3, "20054": 2, "21026": 1, "21108": 1, "25007": 2, "25042": 3, "25056": 3, "25058": 3, "25059": 3, "26025": 1, "28002": 3, "02049": 1, "03038": 3, "03046": 3, "03053": 3, "06079": 2, "08025": 1, "08086": 1}, "mwl_code": null}, "57150": {"id": 57150, "date_creation": "2019-09-29T16:58:29+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-30T18:30:19+00:00", "name": "Azsyuk 2-2 Stevenage, I Came Fifth Overall!", "description": "<p>Okay, so\u2026 hear me out. This was the more fun, less tuned of my two choices for tournaments. But it has a really good core! It went 2-2, and the first loss was close, and the second I blame almost entirely on my bad playing, as I got away from the gameplan. The whole idea came from a certain beautiful person who has a Netrunner stream called the Metropole Grid, where he threw out Khusyuk with 1-costers in Criminal. I can\u2019t remember if he said Az or not, but I instantly heard Az, because of course I did. Credit also to CodeMarvelous, for sharing an Az-connections deck that I then ruined, but retained some of the better features when I built this one! Also thanks to the Slack community, because I workshopped this with them more than even the SSO.</p>\n\n<p>So, the deck is about getting Professional Contacts and the Class Act down, drawing, getting money, installing things with Az discount, and then Khusyuking for the win! Generally, if you can steal once from a small remote, the Khusyuks are really great at closing the game. </p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of cards I\u2019m not sure about, and I\u2019m sure a million that others will see (I will not play Corroder in Az. Never), but it\u2019s a fun, different deck that people really aren\u2019t expecting, and has enough punch to win games. The game descriptions may be kinda lacking, as my memory isn\u2019t the best and most of each of the games, I set up for the first 60% of them.</p>\n\n<p>LOSS: Game one: against a Blue Sun. A really bad match-up for me personally, and possibly the deck. Even with Tycoon, Chiyashi is soo hard to deal with, and they immediately built a huge remote. It was a close game. They left R&amp;D open a long time but I wasn\u2019t able to Khusyuk three times. I got one but the other two were in the bottom five of my deck, and they found Border Controls at the perfect times. Thankfully they didn\u2019t find Scarcity until I\u2019d already installed almost everything I needed. </p>\n\n<p>WIN: Game two: um\u2026 who was I against? Sportsmetal! A rig-shooter one, but thankfully all three Batty\u2019s made their way into the huge remote, and this deck wants to generally ignore remotes unless they\u2019re 1 ice. I used Film Critics a lot on small agendas, just to stop their tempo on score, and managed to get to 3-4 points. They were on 6, and I Khusyuked and then I think Legworked for the win? That may be the other way around. </p>\n\n<p>WIN: Game three: really spiky PE. I was worried. They scored so many 1-pointers and nabbed cards from my hand, including two Khusyuks, and RFGd them with Chronos. I set up well, and started running, and managed to get a Philotic off the last Khusyuk. Film Critic saved me a good bit of damage. I was soo rich in this game, that made the late game a lot easier.</p>\n\n<p>LOSS: Game four: Gagarin assets. I played this one wrong. I spent the first third getting Miss Bones down and trying to keep their assets under control, so by the time they scored to 4, I was way too behind. I Khusyuked twice, but only had 4 1-costers installed, and only got one agenda. This one hurts. I could have done better. </p>\n\n<p>Overall: the deck gets set up quickly! That\u2019s great for a game with fast corps. It used to have Hostage for the 1x Pro Co, but with 2x Pro Co and 2x Class Act, there\u2019s lots of draw and filtering to get what you need and install it. Gaining credits with every draw and spending 0-1 on most installs, along with Armitage, means you tend to do well for money. One game, I had over thirty credits. Most turns for the first half or so of the game are Pro Co twice, play an event/install, and install. </p>\n\n<p>Most important cards: </p>\n\n<p>Pro Co and Class Act. For the reasons above, these cards are fantastic. Class Act draws you 4 instantly, and then makes every Pro Co a filter (when you remember. Jessica is not great at that). Pro Co keeps you from being poor whilst you draw. And they\u2019re each a credit cheaper with Az, so click one Pro Co install doesn\u2019t hurt as much!</p>\n\n<p>Az. He really really is! Sure, it could be argued Leela is a stronger don\u2019t run much runner, but Az\u2019s discounts, even if overall they don\u2019t save a tonne of credits, are so important early to keep your tempo-installing up. </p>\n\n<p>Flip Switch. I was stupid and only had 2x for the Cambridge GNK last week, but it was one of the most important cards, so I went to 3x, and it really is crucial. Although I said you kind of ignore remotes, you can\u2019t let the corp do what they want with an early remote, so having the ability to run it with no breakers and be safe, draining their money, is so useful. This deck is much weaker without Flip Switch. It\u2019s also a 1-coster for Khusyuk, and free for Az, so it ticks all the boxes!</p>\n\n<p>Film Critic. This is an obvious one. The most brokenly great card I think I\u2019ve played with? I tend to avoid a lot of the best cards. It made SDS a breeze, and gave me breathing room in the PE and Sportsmetal deck where their IDs revolve around stealing. I would also have been dead to Punitive several times in the Weyland match ups without it. It\u2019s also 1-cost and free with Az! And not unique, so I sometimes had 2 installed. </p>\n\n<p>Khusyuk! I almost forgot this one. Yeah, this is what the deck\u2019s about. I can\u2019t imagine how horribly bad it would be without it. </p>\n\n<p>PAD Tap. Another kinda obvious one. PAD Tap is really good. </p>\n\n<p>Other good cards:</p>\n\n<p>Legwork. This deck doesn\u2019t have Turning Wheel, so a multi-access card other than Khusyuk, which is very much a late-game card, is really important. Not one of the top five maybe, but I would definitely not want to cut it. If anything, going to 2x would probably be better?</p>\n\n<p>Armitage Codebusting. Not a great econ card in general, but in Az, where it\u2019s installed for free, and you can leave 2 on it if you need the 1-coster for Khusyuk, I think it works really well. I was fairly rich in all my games save the first when I needed to start running a lot. </p>\n\n<p>Passport. Kind of a forgotten breaker, someone on Slack suggested this and I honestly love it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve actually installed Amina in a game since adding Passport? It\u2019s a 1-coster for Khusyuk, doesn\u2019t set you back much at all to install and, for me, really helps me to remember I\u2019m not focussing on remotes. I want to set up and run centrals. Having a breaker suite that only costs 5 credits (not counting turtle) to install is really good. </p>\n\n<p>Every other card:</p>\n\n<p>Diversion of Funds. A lot of people really suggested going to 2x or 3x of this card, and I did, but\u2026 it never feels that valuable in this deck. There was only one time it felt like it might be useful. It\u2019s devastating at times, but those times never seem to come up. It\u2019s definitely in my mind to cut for Nationals unless something changes. </p>\n\n<p>Kati Jones. I\u2019m really not sure about Kati. She was useful in one game, but there may be better. I don\u2019t know. As a 1x, she\u2019s probably fine.</p>\n\n<p>Lucky Charm. This deck already has quite a few 1-costers, and enough Az triggers to get one a turn, so Lucky Charm feels\u2026 it has a use, but I don\u2019t know if it really shouldn\u2019t be something else. Maybe just a Paragon. I cut Paragon because I found I was never installing it, because I wasn\u2019t running much to get value, but it might be better. Saying that, if I had have had it for the first Blue Sun game, I maybe could have Khusyuked an extra time and got the win! Who knows. It doesn\u2019t feel great overall.</p>\n\n<p>Falsified Credentials. I liked it when it was a 1x. I\u2019m still an insecure player, so the safety blankets of expose and such still feels important, so I was happy to find the space for 2x, but\u2026 it didn\u2019t do too much. Maybe it should be a 1x again, or cut completely, I don\u2019t know. </p>\n\n<p>Miss Bones. Very good for keeping assets in check, but\u2026 do I want to keep assets in check? I think, without this card, I maybe would have forgot about assets earlier in my Gagarin game and got on with my plan. It\u2019s a good card, but maybe not for me. </p>\n\n<p>Always Have a Backup Plan. As much as it hurts me to say\u2026 this should probably be the second Legwork or something. It hasn\u2019t done much.</p>\n\n<p>I chose Az because I love Az soo much, and wanted to take a fun deck to a tournament whilst also not getting stomped every game. This deck did that! If things had gone a little different, there\u2019s every chance I could have gone 7-1 overall and made the top cut. There\u2019s definitely the core of a deck that can win quite a few games here. </p>\n\n<p>I feel this write-up may be less useful than my SSO one, because this deck is much more \u2018me\u2019 at the cost of being strong than the SSO one. But it may help clear some things up if anyone is interested in trying it. </p>\n\n<p>Please take it, and maybe try it mostly as-is, just to see? But mostly, have fun with it! As long as people are playing Az, I\u2019m happy. </p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>*I forgot to mention, the Clone Chip and 2x of breakers is another security-blanket thing for me. I don't feel secure at all only having 1x and I'd much rather throw out breakers (or even install a second Tycoon to power up Khusyuk) than not find them, or lose them to damage/SDS and not be able to get them back. But that's absolutely something that could be tweaked for people.</p>\n", "user_id": 30882, "user_name": "I Am Jessica", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"12104": 1, "21045": 1, "21064": 2,

Be sure everything on the board triggers once per turn. An ideal turn goes like this: Gain two from Rezeki. Click to draw or use Deuces to trigger Class Act. Play a run event on R&amp;D or HQ to trigger Maemi, Swift, Amina and Turning Wheel all at once. Install to trigger Grant. Your choice for your last one or two clicks.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, have a sip of a chilled Shizuku Junmai Daiginjo, smile, then pass turn.</p>\n", "user_id": 31240, "user_name": "ClosDeLaRoche", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11008": 3, "12104": 1, "21044": 3, "21045": 2, "21063": 1, "21084": 1, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25026": 3, "25027": 1, "25030": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "26026": 3, "27001": 2, "27002": 2, "03054": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57121": {"id": 57121, "date_creation": "2019-09-25T09:13:48+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-25T09:13:48+00:00", "name": "SOCRX No Longer Latchwork", "description": "<p>Run data dealer vs Sportsmetal.

However, desperation makes Corps do risky things, so a Mushin+Advanced <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Junebug</a> was too tempting to leave unchecked for them. 8 net damage got me win #1!</p>\n\n<p>Round 2: Leela with Film Critic, the ultimate threat to this deck. Was not able to bluff much with plenty of Falsifieds on their side, and a few misplays that negated Mushin+Advances I'd made earlier sunk me. Defeated pretty soundly.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3: Val! I had to play on mobile for this round, and it was awful for everyone involved, apologies to my opponent. Despite not being able to use <a href=\"/en/card/01058\">Archived Memories</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/11080\">Preemptive Action</a> I still managed to sneak out enough Mushins to get a 4-point turn with <a href=\"/en/card/10052\">\"Clones are not People\"</a> after 50 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4: Standard 419. I elected to 241 this round to limit the amount of time spent on mobile, and it was another tense match where I landed several traps at just the right time to heap important breakers. Correctly assumed they'd go for an RD dig instead of faceplanting into another Mushin+Advance which was an agenda this time, able to again get a 4-point turn and score out.</p>\n\n<p>I made the top cut and came back to a real computer the next weekend for much easier playing!</p>\n\n<p>Round 5: Used my runner to great effect!</p>\n\n<p>Round 6: Maxx with Levy! Either you win these early or wait until they exhaust their stack, and the latter gave me the win this time. Didn't land many traps but was able to stack up a <a href=\"/en/card/12013\">Kakugo</a> remote that led to a lot of painful runs.</p>\n\n<p>Round 7: Apoc Val, didn't find the Mushins to make my plays scary, so my double-advance plays didn't work, and they quickly routed me with some good calls including the ultimate bluff-call of \"Freedom\" onto a naked double-advanced card that was indeed an agenda.</p>\n\n<p>Round 8: Lost with my runner.</p>\n\n<p>Biotech's abilities are all useful, but here you want to go Brewery almost every time. With Obokata, <a href=\"/en/card/12013\">Kakugo</a>, and plenty of traps, you get a good shot at leaving the Runner with 1 card at turn's end. If you land a quad-advance <a href=\"/en/card/03009\">Cerebral Sadness</a>, victory is just about guaranteed. I love Greenhouse for the ridiculous ways it lets you score 5/3s disguised as <a href=\"/en/card/25087\">Nisei MK II</a>, but it's not better unless you're against some insane Shaper deck that has Feedback guaranteed. The Tank is the worst pick unless you expect six Wanton Destructions or something.</p>\n\n<p>This is an extremely fun deck except against Film Critic and to a lesser extent Levy. Once you see those hit the table, you have to play very well to win! There are enough tools in here that you won't be floundering against most runners once you have a handle on how they play, Have fun and good luck!</p>\n", "user_id": 6702, "user_name": "Steamwood", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10052": 3, "11032": 3, "11049": 2, "11080": 2, "11092": 2, "12013": 3, "12070": 3, "12113": 2, "21038": 2, "21039": 1, "21051": 2, "21073": 1, "21096": 3, "22038": 1, "25079": 2, "25089": 2, "25091": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "03009": 2, "05007": 2, "05015": 3, "08012": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57107": {"id": 57107, "date_creation": "2019-09-24T00:58:12+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-30T03:46:37+00:00", "name": "Click Clock (2019 Regionals Winnipeg 3-1)", "description": "<p>What is the runner's most valuable tool? <span class=\"icon icon-credit\"></span>s?

And she carried me all the way to the finals.  In the swiss she went 4-1 loosing only to Blue Sun piloted masterfully by @mbzrl who was using Lady Liberty to avoid triggering Leela\u00b4s ability. Then he bounced it back so he could start gathering counters once again. Nice tech. In the cut she went 8-0. Being the higher seed and be always able to choose runner was a strong advantage for me as the runners just seemed better in the given card-pool. Nevertheless, all the opponents played really well. I still vividly recall my finish against Akira when I managed to snatch the winning agenda with all my breakers already in the bin. What a nerve-wrecking match.</p>\n\n<p>As for the card choices there is really nothing special here. Classic Leela. I side-boarded always heavily. I remember that against Sanjay\u00b4s IG I changed around 20 cards. I was so afraid he would play just regular glacier and half of my deck would be useless:). Luckily this did not happen. The trickiest corporation ID to face was probably Blue Sun. I even tried to include the E-box console in two games to dodge Punitive Counterstrike. It also helped with memory so I could slot Stargate to leave agendas in the bin and bounce installed cards at my terms. Later I switched back to Paragon as the tempo gain from it is just too good. </p>\n\n<p>At the end I would like to thank all the participants as well, since you guys made this tournament pleasure to attend.

Essentially the deck plays like regular Val except that you often pay no credits for inject and Stimhack gives you back a click. A bit more about the stranger card choices:</p>\n\n<p>Mystic Maemi - The deck plays enough events that suffering the 3 counter downside never happened. The card did not feel incredible though and might suffer from 46th card syndrome.</p>\n\n<p>Swift - Is it as good as Turntable? Probably no. Is it good? Oh yes. To be honest the most valuable aspect might be getting the extra click when contesting remotes with Stimhack or Run Amok, especially in a Border Control meta. It also let's you Wanton Destruction for 4 cards which has a tendency to make sad corps. It is also very nice with just Dirty Laundry.</p>\n\n<p>Run Amok - This event is somewhat overcosted but with Swift and Maemi you can get both credit and click discounts! It also helps contests rush before you find the breakers needed to contest.</p>\n\n<p>Wanton Destruction - Being able to trash 4 cards from HQ makes this card worthwhile.

The addition from uprising is 2 copies each of La Costa Grid and Digital Rights Management aka DRM. The deck is not fundamentally altered and still plays like a taxing glacier deck. A bit more about card choices:</p>\n\n<p>Nisei MK II and Obokata Protocol - The core agendas.</p>\n\n<p>SSL Endorsement - I don't like psy games but this could reasonable be The Future Perfect or even Bacterial Programming.</p>\n\n<p>Philotic Entanglement - Just a 3/2 to round out the agenda points. With La Costa around this could also be Corporate Sales Team or even Timely Public Release.</p>\n\n<p>Breached Dome - Mostly there as safety to avoid virus farming on archives for Aumakua/Knobkerie. In retrospect this would be better as a Cyberdex Virus Suite.</p>\n\n<p>DRM - Plan A for the deck is to score 2 Niseis followed by an Obokata (or SSL). This card makes this plan much more likely. The advantage over Fast Track is that you save a turn when scoring 5/3s. Not sure you need 2 but it felt like a great use of influence.</p>\n\n<p>Preemptive Action - I played 2 but you probably only need 1.</p>\n\n<p>Bio Vault - Decent end the run upgrade, better with La Costa, still didn't feel amazing.</p>\n\n<p>La Costa - Force the runner to play NGO or Nisei. The main purpose is to drag the runner through the remote and make them spend an extra 4 credits.</p>\n\n<p>IP Block - Cheap, credit taxing barrier that hates on AI for 1 influence? I'll take 2.</p>\n\n<p>Slot Machine - Cheap, credit taxing code gate that hates on Ice Destruction for 1 influence? I'll take 2.</p>\n\n<p>Border Control and Excalibur - Slightly cheesy but these 2 together can create an unassailable remote unless the runner is on AIs. And the deck has IP Block for that.</p>\n\n<p>DNA Tracker - Anansi number 4. Not sure the deck needs 4 Anansis though.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to thank NISEI for organising this tournament and all my opponents for the fun matches we played.

It's a rude deck, especially if you haven't seen this particular brand of hell before and are not sure of your outs.</p>\n\n<p>Hilariously, the person I beat, and then lost twice to in the cut is BraveLilToaster, the progenitor of LeeMaw. Just my luck!</p>\n\n<p>In this version, I decided that making a <a href=\"/en/card/06056\">The Supplier</a> build provided a constant forward momentum that was worth having a slightly slower earlygame. In this meta, there weren't many decks completely selling out to a jammy fast-advance, and Leela's ability plus Gang Signs tends to put the fear of god into them as well. </p>\n\n<p>In an opening hand, you are looking primarily for a source of cards (either <a href=\"/en/card/06120\">Earthrise Hotel</a> or <a href=\"/en/card/26018\">The Class Act</a>) as well as either The Supplier or a <a href=\"/en/card/04004\">Hostage</a> to get him out ASAP. Hostage can also be used to get out both of your one-of connections, <a href=\"/en/card/11030\">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a>, which you want out after The Supplier and The Class Act, as well as <a href=\"/en/card/02091\">Kati Jones</a>, which can wait but doesn't hurt if there's an extra Hostage sitting around.</p>\n\n<p>For influence and other meta-calls: <a href=\"/en/card/03037\">Feedback Filter</a> was preferred over <a href=\"/en/card/12105\">Caldera</a> due to the fact that Gang Signing into a Snare on the corp's turn usually meant the death of your Caldera. <a href=\"/en/card/09035\">Hunting Grounds</a> is a must, since IP Blocks are everywhere, tagging you unconditionally on encounter when your Aumakua is down. <a href=\"/en/card/26026\">Rezeki</a> supports the longer, grindier game that this deck tends to cause, and <a href=\"/en/card/11030\">Beth Kilrain-Chang</a> does the same without the cost to memory, Hostageable, and with even more upside when the corp inevitably stocks up on money as agendas pile in hand. <a href=\"/en/card/21045\">No One Home</a> also allow for some mistakes, making net damage from Snares, surprise Anansis, or tags from Hard-Hitting News hard to stick.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind while piloting this deck is the purpose of the deck isn't to sit back and let the corp sweat, although that is certainly appreciated. Once Maw and Aumakua is down, start getting those sweet, sweet Maw triggers by running once a turn and start winnowing the corp's options. Purging becomes a must to keep you out, hence the one ofs other breakers to get you back in.  A particular weakness of this deck is the singleton breakers that require a run from <a href=\"/en/card/12084\">Rip Deal</a> to get back, so avoiding damage before getting breakers out of your hand while still running is a tough tightrope to walk.</p>\n\n<p>My corporation was <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/52354/vienna-coyote-undefeated-vienna-regionals-\">a rushy Acme</a> that pulled its weight all day.

I find Android Netrunner to be an exceptional game and fall in love with it the first time I have played it.\nI finished at least 2000 games on Jnet over the last 4 years . For the last year or so I have played almost exclusively with runners as I felt it\u2019s more challenging to build a competitive deck with it\u2019s own unique flavor. \nTo me, a minor game flaw has always been the strength of assets in the game. When Spammed and accumulated , they are difficult to handle for the runner. As an avid board game player I always tend to go down the \u201ccontrol\u201d route in games , either via superior economy or board control , which of course is not always the correct strategy. </p>\n\n<p>Ever since the corp started to spam assets out of NEH , Gagarin or RP , I easily became overwhelmed by the the state of the board. I know that great players always find other ways to win the game by smart central runs. Great players don\u2019t get distracted and focus on the most important task at hand, which is winning the game by getting to 7 points before the corp does. They exploit the weakness that come up during the game and use their windows precisely and effectively. \nThat\u2019s not me. I want to decimate their board and be in complete control over the game and just go for the kill when they have absolutely no way to bounce back.</p>\n\n<p>So my runner deck needs answers to all corp variants out there. And i feel that this Leela Build comes pretty close to it.</p>\n\n<p>This deck is of course tailored to my game style. Overall it has an exceptional winrate , but opponents on casual Jnet are on average weaker than the average store championship player and you play less tier 1 meta corp decks. \nBut this deck has persevered the strongest Tier 1 decks currently in the meta . </p>\n\n<p>How to pilot:</p>\n\n<p>Really try to avoid giving early windows for the corp to HHN you. If they threaten with asset spam , don\u2019t worry you will generally catch up later unless they start exceptionally well. \nYou will also catch up to Fast Advance decks, unless of course they also start exceptional well with Atlas Trains .</p>\n\n<p>At one point, the game will shift to your favor . Even your Icebreakers are build to decimate their economy and board state. Corporate \u201cGrant\u201d and Amina can deny the corp 2 credits a turn. \nAnd with Bankrolls, Paragon and /or  Security Testing installed , certain ice becomes indifferent or too costly to rez for the corp once Ankusa is out and running . I have played Ankusa since they day it got released. I love this icebreaker. Against certain decks who rely on advancing Ice or big barriers it is game changing. \nKakugo for instance becomes worthless even without Additional Support through Paragon etc.</p>\n\n<p>Inside Jobs are necessary to threaten the corp when they go to fast, they are also great against SSO Industries: Fueling Innovation . But use them wisely . \nAlgo Trading is great and it\u2019s natural nemesis is hardly played these days. My decks always try to avoid clicking for credits , but to power up Algo Trading it is advisable to click for credits . \nEven if the corp is on match point and managed to build an impregnable server with an advanced Agenda, you still have outs to literally bounce back via Leela by stealing Agendas from centrals. </p>\n\n<p>Stay calm , observe your prey (Corp ) closely and when the time is Right be ruthless until they surrender (they often do ).</p>\n", "user_id": 10023, "user_name": "fiveplus5is55", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10084": 1, "10101": 1, "11004": 1, "11029": 1, "11070": 2, "21044": 3, "21065": 3, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 2, "22010": 2, "22011": 3, "22014": 2, "25026": 2, "25030": 1, "26007": 1, "26016": 1, "26018": 1, "26025": 1, "03038": 2, "03052": 3, "03053": 2, "03054": 1, "05048": 1, "06095": 1, "08062": 2, "08105": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57099": {"id": 57099, "date_creation": "2019-09-23T14:56:26+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-23T14:56:26+00:00", "name": "Corporate 419 ", "description": "\n", "user_id": 22689, "user_name": "Longi", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11004": 1, "11008": 3, "12104": 2, "21044": 3, "21063": 1, "21064": 2, "21104": 1, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "25007": 1, "25010": 1, "25011": 2, "25017": 2, "25024": 1, "25030": 3, "25032": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "03053": 3, "09035": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57100": {"id": 57100, "date_creation": "2019-09-23T14:56:55+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-23T14:56:55+00:00", "name": "Armed Modernism", "description": "\n", "user_id": 22689, "user_name": "Longi", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11016": 3, "11040": 3, "11080": 1, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21036": 2, "21039": 3, "21057": 1, "21080": 3, "21118": 2, "21119": 2, "22056": 2, "23054": 3, "25112": 3, "25124": 3, "25126": 3, "25133": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "26058": 1, "07001": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57101": {"id": 57101, "date_creation": "2019-09-23T17:43:06+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-23T17:44:42+00:00", "name": "Virus Shop", "description": "<p>I built this after watching one of The Metropole Grid's Thursday night streams.

The premise is to install 0-cost cards with Grant, and economize centrals, hence the name.

This was his last major tournament with us before moving far away to start a new chapter of his life.  He went out in typical daine style, overflowing with generosity as he made it rain prize support on all in attendance.  He will be deeply missed by all of us and we were lucky to have him in our meta since nearly the beginning of this game's life.</p>\n\n<p>Also this was my last tournament for some time, as my wife and I are expecting our second child to be born any day now.  Big thanks to my wife for allowing me to even go to this event, and to my brother for coming into town to hang out with her and my daughter so I could play.</p>\n\n<p>Chicagoland Netrunner is without a doubt one of the absolute greatest communities in gaming.  Not only have they pushed me to get better at this game, but also to be a better person.  I am more generous, more confident, more open-minded, and more loving as a result of having known this amazing group of people.  And I am so blessed to have them at my back as I enter this next stage of my life.</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/2WxWfiavndgcM/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Crying Wilfred\" /></p>\n\n<p>So here's to you Chicagoland Netrunner Community!

I started with GFI as my restricted but then pivoted to Mogo once I realized that my ice was basically irrelevant. There's no clot in this meta so if I could FA there was nothing stopping me. The lines are super fun, get money, push 5/3s behind Mogo or FA them with Game Changer. Even with a runner slotting 2x Data Dealer you can still score out using the legendary Mother Goddess and killing the data dealer with Under the Bus. Money doesn't matter and my ice is a joke so it's lovely to see a runner building a board state installing breakers as I score out. </p>\n\n<p>This deck is ultimately weak to Leela, Data Dealer, and a knowledge pilot that knows my deck ahead of time.

They did well to destroy a couple of pieces of ICE on R&amp;D and I was never able to adequately defend it. I had the agendas in hand and a secure remote to win and went for it. I got to 6 points with the Hostile in hand but they got the win on R&amp;D with zero credits and zero clicks remaining. Their ICE destruction allowed this play so well done to them.</p></li>\n<li><p>3rd Round Swiss: Win vs. Laramy Fisk. This was their first tournament and they did extremely well to just miss the top 8. They let a Daily Quest tick over in the remote for 4-5 turns so I had all the money in the world. They stole an agenda and I double Punative'd them.</p></li>\n<li><p>4th Round Swiss: Win vs. 419. I was fortunate in this game. I spent all my credits to rez an Orion and they went to town on my servers for the rest of the turn. Unfortunately for them, they stole 6 points. No Punative in hand though. 1st click draw. 2nd click draw getting my the punative for a win I don't think I deserved.</p></li>\n<li><p>1st Round Cut: Win vs. MaxX. This was the same MaxX I lost to in round 2 of swiss. I can't remember the details too well but it went to plan quite well. I had a good econ start and was able to get the kill after they stole an agenda.</p></li>\n<li><p>3rd Round Cut: Win vs. Hayley. I struggled for econ early this game as I did not want my big ICE destroyed with D4v1d so all 3 of my Oversight AIs went in the bin. They dropped a bit of money trashing a Daily Quest in the remote but they left Ika on a Surveyor though and it got trashed when I returned it to hand. I thought I had no way to win when they were on about 30 credits while slowly building their board. I forced a run through my remote by IAA'ing an NGO Front. They lost most of their money encountering double Surveyor. I was then able to score SSL followed by a Hostile which get me rich. Hayley installed Stargate late in the game but Chiyashi made it difficult for them to get through even over multiple turns as they could not recur D4v1d or Lady. I ended up winning on time but I was about to push a 3-pointer which I am quite sure I could've scored as the remote was 3x Surveyor and 1 Border Control.</p></li>\n</ul><p>Thank you to all my opponents and everyone that turned up to the event.

Never remove a single Virus Breeding Ground from your Freedom decks.</p>\n\n<h2>The Demolisher Experiment</h2>\n\n<p>I wanted to find a way to convert VBG tokens into cold, hard credits. Demolisher in Freedom is... kind of that way? I only installed it a couple of times on the day, and only triggered it at all in one of those games. It didn't make me physically sick having it on the table, but it didn't do anything crazy. Card's pretty balanced, but I wish it were cheaper. Plus 'pretty balanced' is weak for a console. Honestly, it could probably be a Turntable.</p>\n\n<h2>The Rest</h2>\n\n<p>Everything else is fairly standard. Mulligan hard for Yusuf, and if the corp doesn't ice up centrals then just start running and trashing. Otherwise take advantage of all that draw to go looking for whatever you need.</p>\n\n<p>Pelangi and Hippo make for a brutal combo, especially if one or the other is on a Street Peddler. </p>\n\n<p>I have a soft spot for Friday Chip, but I have to face up to the fact that it's a flex slot. At least one of them should be a Stimhack.</p>\n\n<p>The Imp is also to taste. I like being able to nuke big cards and still have Freedom's ability around. It also helps dig deeper into R&amp;D if you're panicking.

There's also a decent argument for running Armed Intimidation instead of Oaktown (shoutout to @firetesting).</p>\n\n<p>When in doubt, jam an agenda.</p>\n\n<p>SWISS: Beat Compilation Hayley, beat Geist, beat Wu, and ID'd the fourth round.</p>\n\n<p>CUT: Beat 419, beat 419.</p>\n", "user_id": 8397, "user_name": "RJorb", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11016": 3, "11040": 3, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "21036": 3, "21039": 2, "21080": 3, "21119": 2, "22056": 2, "23054": 3, "25112": 3, "25124": 3, "25125": 1, "25126": 3, "25130": 2, "25133": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 1, "26058": 1, "05027": 1, "07001": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57035": {"id": 57035, "date_creation": "2019-09-16T06:31:34+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-16T18:36:49+00:00", "name": "Normans Jemison", "description": "<p>This is a Jemison , which I wanted to try a little bit.

She would <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/21084\">embezzle</a> the federal funds, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25026\">occupy public restrooms</a>, <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25059\">cheat at cards</a> and occasionally even <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09030\">bring about the end times</a>. And she <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/11058\">died</a> and did not leave a single good deed behind. <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/25128\">Management</a> caught her and plunged her into a <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01099\">lake of fire</a>. So her <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/04015\">guardian angel</a> stood and wondered what good deed of hers he could remember to tell to G00Ru; \u2018She once played a blind <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/12008\">Mad Dash</a> on R&amp;D,\u2019 said he, \u2018and won the game by scoring a 1 pointer.\u2019 And G00Ru answered: \u2018You take that agenda then, reveal it out to her in HQ, and let her play Mad Dash. And if you can pull her out of the lake, let her come to my <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08031\">Beach Party</a>, but if the Mad Dash fails, then the woman must stay where she is.\u2019 The angel ran to the woman and held out the agenda to her. \u2018Come,\u2019 said he, \u2018run HQ and I\u2019ll pull you out.\u2019 he began cautiously pulling her out. He had just pulled her right out, when the <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/09037\">other</a> <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/08063\">sinners</a> in the lake, seeing how she was being drawn out, began catching hold of her so as to be pulled out with her. But she was a very wicked woman and she began kicking them. \u2018I\u2019m to be pulled out, not you. It\u2019s my agenda, not yours.\u2019 As soon as she said that, the access whiffed. And the woman fell into the lake and she is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and rotated away.</p>\n\n<p>So, funny story. I was originally planning on playing McBeasts' Compilation Hayley after seeing it win Swedish nats and seeing Asger use Compile to great effect. I did however not manage to get comfy with Brahman in time, and decided to play the other deck I had brough with me up north - Liza, intended as for casual games post-tournament, being fully aware of how much the Scots love their Argus. I mostly managed to dodge Tag-punishment decks, barring Will whom I won against by virtue of him only having two HPTs in his deck - I'd have been toast otherwise.  The deck went on to vastly outperform my expectations, carrying me into the final and proving that Liza has legs, no matter the meta.</p>\n\n<p>I think that Liza has a 30% matchup against Argus - it's not great, but certainly winnable, and I believe that if I had played it better against Matt (who was an excellent sport and someone I look forward to facing again) it may well have ended differently. Big thanks also to Duncan, Seamus, Alice and all the other lovely people at the tournament!</p>\n", "user_id": 28443, "user_name": "DonLoverGate", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11008": 2, "12008": 3, "12104": 3, "21064": 3, "21065": 3, "21084": 3, "21104": 2, "21105": 3, "22008": 1, "22009": 3, "22011": 3, "25010": 2, "25024": 2, "25026": 3, "25027": 2, "25032": 2, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26004": 2, "26016": 2, "09030": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57041": {"id": 57041, "date_creation": "2019-09-16T12:19:01+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-16T20:21:07+00:00", "name": "Neural Jemison", "description": "<p>No way out  armed intimidation plays.</p>\n", "user_id": 31442, "user_name": "bing005", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10094": 2, "11050": 1, "11080": 1, "11094": 1, "11097": 2, "12016": 1, "12018": 3, "12098": 3, "21038": 1, "21057": 3, "21080": 3, "21119": 2, "22056": 2, "23054": 3, "26056": 2, "26058": 1, "26117": 1, "01094": 3, "01103": 1, "01101": 2, "01072": 1, "02018": 1, "06111": 1, "01058": 1, "01070": 2, "06048": 1, "08059": 1, "08074": 1, "01110": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57042": {"id": 57042, "date_creation": "2019-09-16T12:19:38+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-17T11:29:31+00:00", "name": "kit and kaboodle", "description": "<p>It's a bad deck.

This deck was my attempt at making it less poor and including a kill package to encourage runners to hang back while all the pieces came together.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite bits of this deck are including Dedication Ceremony without the Reconstruction Contracts that you normally see, and the inclusion of Red Level Clearance.  The Dedication Ceremonies felt like pieces that you'd either land on City Works, use on Contract Killer for a kill, or possibly land on advanceable ice to strengthen your servers a bit.  Reconstruction Contracts, in the context of this deck, would have crowded out econ (IPO) or kill pieces (Hard-Hitting News, High-Profile Target), neither of which I was willing to give up.  I love Red Level Clearance in Titan, and it serves many of the same purposes here.</p>\n\n<p>The day went roughly as follows:</p>\n\n<p>R1 vs. Smoke.  My opponent couldn't find any breakers, but I couldn't find any agendas to score to take advantage of that, save a City Works that I Dedicated out.  Eventually I install-advanced an Overwriter and an Oberth, which my opponent ran, only to face five brain damage on a full hand.  I finished things off next turn with a Dedicated Contract Killer.  I heard about this game for the rest of the day as my opponent was more used to playing this sort of jank (cf. their normal Cybernetics Division decks) than having it sprung on them.</p>\n\n<p>R2 vs. Swift/Wanton Destruction Val.  I Dedicated a City Works behind an Archer, which my opponent ran, only to notice that the City Works would do 7 damage instead of the expected 5, thanks to the forfeited Hostile.  They broke just enough with MKUltra to jack out, draw up, and then come back in...and still wound up with a full hand, thanks to I've Had Worse, a stolen agenda, and 10 credits in the bank.  Needless to say, I lost that game after Stargate chucked some agendas in the bin.</p>\n\n<p>R3 vs. Freedom. My opponent found all of the credit economy they needed, but no breakers, and I was able to work to five points.  Breakers started coming online around then, and I tried to threaten HHN/HPT, but they had too much money to make that reasonable.  After surviving some R&amp;D digging, made easier by Hippo'ing several pieces of ice, I was able to get an Atlas out for the win.</p>\n\n<p>R4 vs. Val (same player as R2).  I was fully expecting to lose this matchup, but I had won R2 and R4 on the Runner side due to some agenda flood, and my opponent was a little bit tilted.  I got Mining Accident'd early, scored out a City Works and a Hostile, and then watched my opponent start Eater'ing through my ice and Embezzle'ing away my ineffective kill pieces due to the credit differential.  Somewhere in the midst of the Stargate runs starting, I Oberth'd out an Atlas, and that enabled an Audacity'd Atlas for the win next turn.</p>\n\n<p>If I played this again, I think I'd trade out the HHN/HPT/Data Ravens for another Red Level and...something else, maybe a Biotic + Ark Lockdown.  Mother Goddess also seems like a nice fit for a unicorn, and maybe an Excalibur instead of Oduduwa.</p>\n", "user_id": 29263, "user_name": "zegrid", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10017": 3, "11016": 2, "11097": 2, "12016": 1, "12018": 3, "12058": 1, "12098": 2, "21057": 1, "21078": 3, "21079": 1, "21119": 2, "23054": 3, "25089": 1, "25112": 2, "25124": 3, "25126": 3, "25127": 1, "25130": 2, "25133": 2, "25134": 2, "25138": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26037": 2, "03009": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-4"}, "57044": {"id": 57044, "date_creation": "2019-09-16T13:27:37+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-16T13:27:37+00:00", "name": "Adam 2.0 (1st, 3-1 Indy GNK)", "description": "<p>This deck is my second attempt at Adam.  The first attempt was taking the Engolo Adam decks floating around and swapping Laamb for Engolo (look at all the influence I saved, Ma!), along with some other changes given the extra influence.  That didn't work out so well.  With recent MWL changes, I decided to just build an Adam deck like I would a Criminal deck, figuring that extra breakers would come out faster and could also be targets for Emergent Creativity to save money in a pinch.  I also like the Find the Truth/Mad Dash combo.</p>\n\n<p>Directives for every game were Find the Truth/Safety First/Neutralize All Threats.</p>\n\n<p>R1 vs. Saraswati.  I don't remember a whole lot about this game; we had actually just started the game while waiting for the GNK to start, and then got paired up in the first round.  We decided to just keep playing.  I didn't make many runs, but the four runs I did make resulted in three agendas for the win.</p>\n\n<p>R2 vs. Azmari.  I dislike this matchup, though I felt Mad Dash might even the odds a little bit.  I kept the remote clear via Stimhack and managed to yank an SSL out of the remote in the middle of the game.  As luck would have it, my opponent was moderately flooded most of the game, and I wound up pulling two agendas on the last run of the game.</p>\n\n<p>R3 vs. Gagarin.  I hate asset spam matchups; I never know what to trash and when, and Gagarin features the constant HHN/HPT threat.  Some HQ runs midgame revealed that my opponent had all the pieces in-hand, and I struggled to keep my credits up while still installing pieces to try and challenge servers.  That is, until I got impatient and decided to try and clear out the Rashida on top of R&amp;D.  I faceplanted into an R&amp;D Archer with only Na'Not'K to protect me.  10 credits, ouch.  A couple of turns later, there were pieces of bioroid everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>R4 vs. Azmari (same player as R2).  As I tried to make money and install enough pieces to gain a free draw from Safety First, I watched my opponent draw and toss many things into Archives.  Running Archives to get peeks at R&amp;D, I was surprised to see things like Ash, Daily Quest, and DRM in the bin.  What I should have figured out--and learned after the game--was this meant there were a ton of points in HQ.  I grabbed one agenda out of HQ via Logic Bomb, got suckered into spending another one on an NGO (?) in the remote, but still had my third one in hand to Mad Dash into the remote to grab the final agenda for the win.</p>\n\n<p>I was happy with the amount of drip econ; I was consistently able to get to two credits or more per turn.

If you sequence your ice and agenda installs properly the runner can end up too poor to contest, or you can just get free points if they are tired of checking. This shell-game-like component of the deck is something that hasn't been prominent in high-tier Netrunner play for a while so it feels very refreshing. The Sportsmetal ability helps break locks through Stargate and has some cool synergies against Khusyuk, otherwise it usually is an ID that makes 10-12 credits in a game which is awesome.

Even when she's engaging in outright criminal activity she provides full disclosure. When she uses her clout to sabotage a corp, she makes sure they know every single thing about her - including her shoe size - and her every action is documented by a team of paparazzi and broadcasted to a weirdly apathetic, scandal-fatigued public.</p>\n\n<p>The basic game plan is probably obvious enough but here it is anyway. Keep up with the corp's tempo by drawing cards with Liza and slowing them down with Diversion of Funds. Use Paragon and Blueberry Diesel to find your meat damage protection package: Paparazzi, Dummy Box and Wireless Net Pavilion. If you're against a kill deck you might want to use The Class Act instead of Liza to try to dig these pieces out and keep your tag count at a minimum, but I usually just start playing tag-me immediately and race to get everything installed before the corp draws High-Profile Target. Even if you're not playing against a kill deck, Wireless Net Pavilion and Dummy Box are great for keeping your high tempo economy assets alive - Rogue Trading is a huge tempo swing in your favour if you don't have to worry about clearing the tags, and you can actually use Dummy Box to block the trash ability on PAD Tap. Once you're set up, and reliably contesting the corp's scoring remote, you can fast-forward to a win with a Counter Surveillance run on R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p>This decklist could definitely be refined and tweaked depending on your local meta and your personal preference. Aeneas Informant is here to help maintain tempo against asset spam decks, but I think the correct number of this card to include is either 3 or 0 because you can't really start profiting off of exposed Gagarin remotes unless you have all three installed. Hostage could be slotted in to make it easier to find Film Critic, The Class Act and your third Aeneas Informant in relevant matchups. Gbahali is here as another resource to throw at Dummy Box and a way to cheat out accesses during Counter Surveillance runs even when your breakers are trashed. However, there might be a better way to spend that influence. Lucky Charm could potentially do Gbahali's job better (aside from being hardware) since it can prevent the corp from ending your Counter Surveillance runs by popping Border Control. Film Critic is nice to have against SDS Drone Deployment in a deck with few breakers and no recursion, but there's an argument that the restricted card should be Levy AR Lab Access so that you can recur your copies of Counter Surveillance and so you can throw a virtually unlimited number of resources to Dummy Box when the corp is determined to trash your Paparazzi. There could also be room in this deck for No One Home as I find that I tend to lose against net damage based kill combos - but that probably has more to do with my own inexperience against those decks, because this deck should actually be favoured against those decks thanks to the extra draw from Liza.</p>\n", "user_id": 27357, "user_name": "Creaphis", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"12023": 2, "12044": 2, "12104": 3, "12108": 3, "21047": 2, "21065": 3, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "22008": 1, "22012": 1, "25027": 2, "25030": 3, "25032": 3, "25033": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26012": 3, "26016": 1, "26018": 2, "08086": 1, "08087": 3, "08108": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57010": {"id": 57010, "date_creation": "2019-09-15T05:20:35+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-15T06:32:29+00:00", "name": "Cake or Tags?

That's fine with me, I wanted it to be a winner, but still. Considering that Mirrormorph isn't seen as all that threatening, this deck is a lot meaner than I was expecting it to be.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of the usual strategy of doubling-down on taxing the runner's clicks with MCA Austerity Policy and Enhanced Login Protocol, this deck is designed to tax the runner's credits and disrupt their rig just enough to maintain a credit advantage that you can exploit with Ash. Start the game by playing efficiently and getting as many Mirrormorph clicks as you can. Even when you aren't doing anything fancy with the extra Mirrormorph click, and your turns just look like \"draw a card, install a card, take a credit, take Mirrormorph credit,\" you've still essentially clicked for two credits which is a good enough deal and those extra credits will be enough to make Ash fire at the end of the game. If you aren't taking three different actions you should be installing three cards to empty your hand for Violet Level Clearance.</p>\n\n<p>If you have the opportunity, and you often will, you should rush out an SSL Endorsement behind Hagen and put the runner at a major score and credit disadvantage right away. You can also rush Ikawah Project behind Fairchild 3.0 or Turing if you have the credits for it. Then, once the mid-game rolls around you can start threatening to fast-advance your 5/3 agendas with MCA Austerity Policy, and here's where the cruelty of the deck really starts to show. Clearing out a server with MCA, Ash and Warroid Tracker is exceptionally taxing to the runner, and when it's all over they won't even have any points to show for it. At that point you can typically install-advance-advance the agenda that you were about to fast-advance and the runner won't be able to come back. Finally, you can score your last point with relative ease by innocently installing Echo Chamber (or Tech Startup to fetch Echo Chamber) in your scoring remote. Again, the runner doesn't get any points for trashing it and they'll have to contend with Warroid Tracker if they do.</p>\n\n<p>Some card choices here might look weird but they get results. Drudge Work is the right flood protection in this deck because it can be tutored and Mirrormorph loves spending clicks on asset actions. Echo Chamber is a rare splash but it does a ton of work and wins games in a deck that's already running asset tutors to grab MCA Austerity Policy, Drudge Work and Nanoetching Matrix. Jua is an even rarer splash - I could be the first person to run this card as far as I know - but it does what I want it to do. It's a three-strength sentry that's only 2 credits to rez. The runner doesn't want to let the sub fire and they also don't want to pay to break it. Put it on a central server and the runner will leave that server alone well into the mid-game. The on-encounter effect can also disrupt shapers if you have Jua installed in front of other unrezzed ice, forcing them to pop their SMCs early without full information.</p>\n\n<p>As for the cards I didn't include: NGO is too cheap to trash out of R&amp;D, it's anti-synergistic with Mirrormorph to install-advance-advance it, and it isn't an especially believable bluff when your main win condition is to fast-advance 5/3s with MCA Austerity Policy. Calvin B4L3Y, Red Level Clearance and Lateral Growth were considered but they don't provide enough of a tempo advantage to justify their slots. Also, I'm not running Border Control because as a 1-strength barrier it's too cheap to break, and in this deck you want every piece of ICE to tax the runner every single time they touch it.</p>\n", "user_id": 27357, "user_name": "Creaphis", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11049": 3, "11060": 3, "11111": 3, "12068": 2, "12111": 3, "12112": 1, "21010": 3, "21015": 1, "21034": 2, "21038": 3, "21118": 2, "22052": 1, "25068": 1, "25077": 2, "25082": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26031": 1, "26034": 3, "26035": 3, "06061": 2, "06088": 1, "08020": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "57021": {"id": 57021, "date_creation": "2019-09-15T15:24:26+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-08T16:42:46+00:00", "name": "Butterly Collection (3-1 Gamescape GNK)", "description": "<p>This is a fun expansion on Mushin PE decks, leaning a bit more towards never advance with all the assets and 3-1 agendas.

These giant MaxX decks have been around for a while, so I make no claim to originality here. I Just like where this version has ended up. </p>\n\n<p>It's a fantastic exercise in improvisation. You're never sure what your strategy is going to be, but Anarch has enough good cards that synergize that it'll probably work out. Sometimes you win with only an Eater and a Stargate. Sometimes you have 10 cards installed. Sometimes you get District 99 turn one and you can DDoS things forever. You'll figure it out.</p>\n\n<p>As for how to play this pile of orange stuff, if you're not sure what you need, mulligan for Patchwork or Inject. Patchwork is an econ engine on its own and Inject will give you more options. Always keep an eye on which breakers are in the bin. (It can be hard.) Don't draw looking for a specific answer; you're not going to find it. Your heap has all the answers you need. And as always, having credits is having options, so fall back on that. </p>\n\n<p>Potential changes? Whatever. Do what you want, this is pure fun. I use 99 cards because it's a nod to the EDH format, but that's not a rule. I posting this because this is likely my last version before Uprising comes out, not because it is the pinnacle of performance.</p>\n\n<p>Finally: maybe stick to jnet with this one? Or if you're going to build it in meatspace, set aside some time to practice shuffling 100 sleeved cards.</p>\n", "user_id": 4079, "user_name": "Thike", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10020": 1, "10085": 3, "10098": 1, "11008": 1, "11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11061": 2, "11081": 3, "12104": 3, "21103": 3, "21107": 2, "22007": 3, "25005": 2, "25007": 3, "25009": 3, "25011": 2, "25013": 3, "25016": 3, "25017": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25062": 2, "25065": 3, "26004": 3, "03038": 2, "03053": 3, "03054": 3, "06033": 3, "06073": 3, "07029": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 3, "07036": 3, "07037": 2, "07038": 2, "07039": 2, "07040": 2, "08021": 3, "08043": 1, "08103": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56971": {"id": 56971, "date_creation": "2019-09-10T03:42:18+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-26T21:36:50+00:00", "name": "fork version 60000", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 24661, "user_name": "themeanlady", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10101": 1, "11030": 1, "11085": 1, "12088": 1, "21088": 2, "21108": 1, "22020": 1, "25007": 2, "25039": 1, "25048": 1, "25050": 3, "25056": 3, "25058": 3, "25059": 3, "26024": 1, "26025": 2, "03037": 1, "03038": 3, "03046": 3, "03053": 2, "06033": 1, "06037": 3, "08025": 1, "08043": 2, "08085": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "56972": {"id": 56972, "date_creation": "2019-09-10T08:07:50+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-10T08:07:50+00:00", "name": "Apex - Invasive Predator", "description": "\n", "user_id": 34035, "user_name": "Kapteeni", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"11008": 3, "11061": 2, "11086": 1, "11087": 3, "12028": 3, "12104": 2, "21008": 2, "21068": 3, "22023": 3, "25059": 3, "07045": 1, "08103": 2, "09029": 1, "09030": 3, "09031": 3, "09032": 3, "09033": 3, "09034": 1, "09035": 2, "09036": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "56973": {"id": 56973, "date_creation": "2019-09-10T08:25:32+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-10T16:31:40+00:00", "name": "Adam Legacy", "description": "<p>Bought the whole collection from an old player.

I was lucky enough to make my way to a win with this deck together with standard <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56658/-just-play-the-normal-good-gagarin-york-1st-place-4-1-\">Hostile Gagarin</a>. A big thank you to the organizers, everyone I met and I had a lot of fun games during the days!</p>\n\n<p><strong>During the day I played against:</strong>\n</p>Game 1: Bye\n\n<p></p>Game 2: NBN Making News (win)\n\n<p></p>Game 3: The Outfit (ID), although we played for fun and Hayley won\n\n<p></p>Game 4: Hostile Gagarin (win)\n\n<p></p>Tiebreaker: Hostile Gagarin (win)\n\n<p></p>Top Cut, Game 1: The Outfit (loss)\n\n<p></p>Grand Finals: Hostile Gagarin (win)\n\n<h3><strong>THE DECK</strong></h3>\n\n<p>This deck is a refined version of <a href=\"https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56734/compilation-hayley-1st-aarhus-regionals-\">Compilation Hayley</a>, with focus on effective breakers and recursion from Brahman (bouncing D4, Lady etc). The deck is extremely fun to play and you always have a lot of lines to take.</p>\n\n<p>While writing this, the new MWL have not been announced yet, so we'll just have to wait and see how the meta changes. Also, the new cards that was recently released was not legal during this tournament.</p>\n\n<p>I won't go in card by card, but basically you want a starting hand with Professional Contacts and Aesop's, and pray that the Corp doesn't play Scarcity of Resources (which is really good against this deck). Draw for other cards, get money, shop things you don't need and Compile for breakers or other stuff you need.</p>\n\n<p>Again, Hayley is great fun to play, Compile is a good card and I'm looking forward the new meta and hopefully this archetype will still be viable to play.

Shrike was definitely worth the influence, though obviously the install cost was nothing to be pleased about. For the new MWL I think Engolo can be dropped for a Gordian, and go up to 3 SMC (dropping a Mem Chip, which did not need to be a 3-of). Dropping a Paricia for the 3rd Technical Writer is probably worth it as well.</p>\n\n<p>My Argus deck was bog standard (one extra HPT for safety in the Freedom matchup).</p>\n\n<p>Round 1: Adam/SSO. The SSO game was a bit scary when I went down 3-6 early and hit a triple advanced Hortum. But I was able to clear out a CVS and then the game just snowballed from there, and two Khusyuk's closed it. Against Adam I scored an Atlas with 2 counters behind a Data Raven on turn 4, and despite being behind on money, was able to just draw and force scores.</p>\n\n<p>Round 2: Val/NEH Played against @tf34, probably the closest two games of the day. Don't remember much of the Val game, but both of us got to high points, money was close, but then a No One Home was dropped I and I knew it was lost. Turning Wheel and 4 bad pub meant I couldn't do much. Against TBB's NEH I got basically the nuts opening with ProCo and Astrolabe. I was able to contest and deal with un-iced remotes, but couldn't find a program other than Engolo/Shrike. That was enough to get me through a scoring remote that was TG/Wraparound/TG for all of my money 3 times (for 5 points). 3 Amani's meant eventually my Engolo was bounced, and I dipped too low to dodge an HHN. I was able to keep the clot threat up, but didn't have enough money to challenge the game winning point in the remote. Clicked for credits, dropped the Engolo and Khusyuk'd for 4 and found the winning agenda on the last card.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3: Freedom/RP First of two very lucky corp wins. Scored an Atlas with a counter turn 1 Despite being down on money, and having all of the bad pub early, I was able to draw through free runs on R&amp;D, and score Atlas with a counter, and 2 Hostiles Takeovers. Then forced a bunch of tags to stop a GFI score, and then eventually landed the kill. I don't remember the RP matchup, but it was a slow start, and despite scoring an early Nisei, I traded one for a Khuysuk and got the one that was sitting in the remote. Was able to take 2 Obokatas, one from an HQ access and one from another Khusyuk dig.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4: Based on SOS was able to ID with the one Gagarian player that made the cut. Got some nice pastries and discussed hypothetical MWLs.</p>\n\n<p>Cut Game 1: Played TF34 again, he was higher seed, and chose Val. Had a rocket start with 2 hedges, 2 TBTF, 2 Hostiles that allowed me to land an HHN despite a No One Home. He was able to rebirth into Ed, but I draw a Consulting visit while digging, and he hit an Econ Warfare on the top, and saw a HPT below.</p>\n\n<p>Cut Game 2: Against @neuropantser Fake Moons deck. Got off to a very slow start, and was not able to keep up the tempo loss of dealing with the major assets. Even 2 Paricia was not enough to keep up.</p>\n\n<p>Cut Game 3: Played TF34 for the fourth time, swapping sides. This time I held off installing my ProCo in my opening hands because I didn't want to lose it to an early Amani. But I didn't think to change my play pattern when I was able to check and see there wasn't any down. Fell behind on money/tempo, so he was able to score out before I could really challenge.</p>\n\n<p>All in all a fun time, and revealed why so many of my deck choices were mistakes!

The highlight was using it to trash D4vid on a Batty psi game, ensuring a Chiyashi flatline.

Plus, even with MaxX and Inject, I\u2019m not infrequently clicking for draws to keep the Patchwork full.</li>\n<li>Second Levy AR Lab Access: I am a cowardly coward who cowers. Plus see above re: incremental damage decks (Obokatas are very popular) and feeding the Patchwork.  </li>\n<li>Second Retrieval Run: While two ReRuns often mean they\u2019re dead after the first Levy I\u2019ll accept that over losing a game against rush/Argus because my Engolos &amp; Corroders get milled and my ReRun is at the bottom of my deck. </li>\n<li>Stargate: Stargate is nutso, especially in a meta with a not inconsiderable number of Snares!, hard-to-steal agendas, and Punitive Counterstrikes. It turns ice destruction up to overdrive, lets you pick your spots perfectly, and overall is awesome. The MU pressure is not inconsiderable but often your goal is to run solely on Stargate + Engolo + one of Corroder/MKU and trade out if needed.</li>\n<li>Political Operative: A good catch-all that can be fed to Patches. It is the shameful 46th card which could just as easily be cut.</li>\n</ul><p>Weirdly the deck this feels reminiscent of is Sifr-Parasite Shaper; while obviously your ice destruction rig is much, much more expensive, it has the same feeling of spending much of the game making money and threatening the remote, and using your opponent\u2019s hesitation to tear open R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p>On the day it beat Sportsmetal combo, SSO glacier, and Palana glacier twice. Political Operative did nothing and could probably be cut. The deck felt exceptionally strong. Too bad my corp choice was poor and my luck was lackluster.

So I propose corporations return to an ancient time, a pre-money age. I propose:</p>\n\n<p>THE BARTER SYSTEM\n<img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/C8oCrFudETFRL01SMB/giphy.gif\" alt=\"I don't want your money\" /></p>\n\n<p>Let the runner have infinite money, even slot 3x Medical Research Fundraiser to help them achieve this goal. IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER. The Barter System isn\u2019t concerned with money. It wants your cards. Trade us your cards for accesses. Trade us your cards for agendas. BARTER WITH US.</p>\n\n<p>This deck helped me win the 2019 Colorado Regionals, going undefeated (5-0). The core of this deck isn\u2019t anything revolutionary. It\u2019s a 1,000 cuts style deck that doesn\u2019t aim to kill the runner so much as out-tempo them, and eventually set up a remote that requires the runner to have an absurd number of cards in hand to get it. I think the most unique thing about this deck is that it foregoes Snares and Breached Domes in favor of more ice and operations.</p>\n\n<p>Mulligan for House of Knives and Nisei Mk 3s. Rush these out ASAP. The net damage from PE\u2019s ability will disrupt the runner as they set up. I also use my first few HOK tokens to tempo-hit the runner, then I save about 2 HOK tokens to try to close the game with an Obokata score. Build a remote with one Kakugo and one Data Loop. That\u2019s usually all you need. A remote with a Kakugo, Data Loop, 1 or 2 HOK tokens, 1 Nisei token, Ben Musashi, and PE\u2019s ability will almost always guarantee that you can close the game with Obo (unless the runner is on Film Critic, but then again, that\u2019s why we slot 2 Voter Intimidations).</p>\n\n<p>Now, if the runner has a Feedback Filter, you'll probably lose. I got lucky and didn't play against any Feedback Filters in this tournament. However, Feedback Filter can get very expensive, so you might be able to sneak out a cheeky Punitive win if they steal an Obo and go too low on credits (but this is the barter system, so I wouldn't count on out-moneying the runner).</p>\n\n<p>Fun includes in this deck:</p>\n\n<p>3x Mausolus - This one of the greatest PE cards ever printed. This card almost always costs only 3 to rez because it\u2019s so expensive to break all 3 subs (especially with Black Orchestra). And it has the magic words \u201cDo 1 net damage.\u201d In PE, the runner simply cannot let this fire. I usually use this as my centrals defense as I set up a disgusting Kakugo/Data Loop remote. I think you could also stack Mausoluses on a remote against a runner with Feedback Filter and make it VERY expensive to get in (but again, I wouldn't count on running down their money as a winning strategy).</p>\n\n<p>2x Voter Intimidation - Because we simply cannot allow a Film Critic. Also very good against Hunting Grounds and Caldera. Slot 2 to ensure that you see 1.</p>\n\n<p>3x Medical Research Fundraiser - Because Barter System doesn't care how much money the runner has.</p>\n\n<p>2x Preemptive - Because EVERY deck needs more Preemptive. It\u2019s always the first thing that gets cut, but it literally saves games. And like I say: slot 2 if you want to ensure that you see 1! Worst case scenario, it recycles your operation econ back into the deck.</p>\n\n<p>1x Punitive - Because if they spend too much on Feedback Filter or breaking Mausoluses, you can maaaaybe get the kill. Or do a value Punitive for tempo.</p>\n\n<p>1x Junebug - Honestly, this was a morning-of-the-tournament include for me. I put it in just for the LOLz. Turns out, it was the REASON I made the cut (it got me a cheap kill when I was otherwise totally locked). I like the idea of having just 1 Junebug in the deck. I think it can create a mind game with the runner (ANY CARD COULD BE THE JUNEBUG! MWAHAHAHA!). Every corporation should run a 1-of Junebug for cheap wins.</p>\n\n<p>Happy bartering everyone!</p>\n", "user_id": 22076, "user_name": "timmysaurusrex", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10106": 2, "11032": 2, "11080": 2, "11092": 2, "11097": 3, "12013": 3, "12054": 2, "12070": 3, "12095": 2, "21039": 3, "21051": 1, "21080": 3, "25084": 1, "25087": 3, "25088": 1, "25089": 1, "25138": 1, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "05004": 3, "05014": 3, "05017": 1, "08014": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.2"}, "56924": {"id": 56924, "date_creation": "2019-09-08T08:52:13+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-08T08:52:13+00:00", "name": "Ryper v2.2 4th Mallorca Regional", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 16873, "user_name": "Corbec", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10094": 2, "11033": 1, "11050": 2, "11080": 1, "11112": 3, "12095": 2, "12098": 1, "21019": 1, "21059": 1, "21078": 3, "21080": 3, "22055": 3, "23054": 3, "25123": 1, "25124": 2, "25130": 1, "25133": 2, "25137": 3, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 2, "26056": 3, "26058": 2, "06111": 1, "07015": 2}, "mwl_code": null}, "56925": {"id": 56925, "date_creation": "2019-09-08T08:52:14+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-09T15:10:33+00:00", "name": "Loliclip Adam - 4th Mallorca Regional", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 16873, "user_name": "Corbec", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10045": 1, "11024": 1, "11025": 1, "11085": 1, "11087": 2, "21028": 3, "21029": 2, "21089": 3, "21107": 1, "21108": 1, "25007": 2, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "25063": 2, "26030": 1, "03053": 3, "07055": 3, "09037": 1, "09039": 3, "09040": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "56926": {"id": 56926, "date_creation": "2019-09-08T12:21:36+00:00", "date_update": "2019-10-02T07:23:53+00:00", "name": "Planet of the Apes MaxX (2nd, Boston Regionals)", "description": "<p><img data-src=\"https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DefenselessPerfumedBedbug-size_restricted.gif\" alt=\"5 minutes into embezzle and chill and the corp gives u this look\" /></p>\n\n<p>There is an unwritten social contract in Netrunner: the corp pays money to set up defenses.

Or, even better, don't imagine, play it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Rezeki: Since we aren't on Levy, we need drip econ. I like Rezeki more than <a href=\"/en/card/07055\">Data Folding</a> because I'm not obligated to find and play my console to keep the credits flowing, and also I can play a console that costs 2.</p></li>\n<li><p>Embezzle: This card is absolutely nuts right now. Literally every relevant deck hates to see this card. It singlehandedly makes you favored over Gagarin without Hacktivist or bad pub, and it can chaos dunk IG, NEH, and Argus into the shadow realm with good hits. It also makes you feel incredibly bad when you hit agendas, which I consider a feature and not a bug.</p></li>\n<li><p>Maker's: I wasn't willing to contort my deck to play Khusyuk, and I have very good HQ pressure, so Maker's it was.

I ran centrals and punished the flood.</p>\n\n<p>Round 2 - Sam N. on AgInfusion: Astute readers have likely already notice I have no ways to break a strength 3 mythic ice. That is intentional; I assumed Pelangi and Engolo would hate them out. I was unable to disrupt a Nisei chain behind Excalibur, and I could only find 3 points in centrals before he had the Excal + Nisei + Obokata to win.</p>\n\n<p>Round 3 - Chris F. on Palana: This was a nasty ice + Shipment from Tennin glacier. I successfully challenged an early Nisei play, he SfT'd a Yagi-Uda, and I started spending a fair amount of money to get into centrals every turn. Midgame, I chose to steal an Obokata, trashing my last Labor Rights and SoT, meaning I was stuck with single Rezeki drip and whatever my deck gave me the rest of the game. Thankfully, the deck coughed up just enough Hippo, D4, and Rebirth to buy me enough accesses for the winning Yagi-Uda.</p>\n\n<p>Round 4 - Toby F. on NEH: Textbook win vs. NEH. Had great early money, kept everything relevant off the board, he didn't have enough creds or clicks to ice centrals, and I picked the points out of HQ/R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p>Top 4, game 1 - Ian M. on Gagarin: Barely squeaked into the cut on extended SoS and Ian chose to corp. This game was incredibly stressful. I managed to connect on 3 full Embezzles throughout the game, trashing 2 HHN, 2 HPT, and 2 other operations I've forgotten. I spent a decent amount of money trashing the board, and I checked centrals, so his turn 1 Paywall and later Drudge Work kept him rich despite the middling board. I was able to find an SSL and SDS, then got HHN'd when I was on about 20 credits. Given cards in hand, I did not have enough clicks to drop Corroder, trash Judge, and also clear enough tags to not die to HHN, so I opted for the stalling game instead--clear just enough tags and draw just enough cards not to die to the single HPT left in the deck, and hit centrals with every other click. Eventually hit a turn where I didn't have enough money left to do that, so I went broke trashing assets in R&amp;D and found the winning SDS click 4.</p>\n\n<p>Grand Finals, game 2 - Toby F. on NEH: Textbook loss vs. NEH. Had early but not sustainable money, got HHN'd after spending it to clear the board, only drew resource econ from there on. Whiffed an Embezzle for good measure. I managed to keep this closer than it had any right to be by squeezing accesses wherever I could, but eventually they ran dry.</p>\n\n<p>My corp was Greg Tongue's Unban CI You Cowards. My thoughts on the deck are: a) its name is right, b) Fully Operational is actually extremely good, and c) people have 1000% forgotten how to play against Lakshmi so if you remember how to Lakshmi as corp you can get free wins. Highly recommend, the deck carried me despite shaky play on the day.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, why play this deck? Three reasons.</p>\n\n<p>1) It sucks when your rounds go to time. This deck is fast.</p>\n\n<p>2) 0 is a way better number than 5.</p>\n\n<p>3) You know the cards in Netrunner? The corp's ice? The corp's operations? The corp's assets? 2/3 of the cards in your very deck, as well as whatever you hit with brain damage? They belong in the trash. Let's put them there. You get to be the maniac. You get to blow it all up.

Seeing players' faces when they realize it's a Mwanza deck is great.</p>\n\n<p>Games went as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Game #1 (win), vs. Freedom: Had a decent start.  Runner Hippo'd through HQ and ran a bunch, stealing SDS and SSL.  I used an Atlas counter to find Punitive Counterstrike, and squeaked by the trace with a couple of credits.</p>\n\n<p>Game #2 (loss), vs. Val: In this matchup I couldn't find the agendas fast enough.  I thought they were running 2 of each conspiracy breaker so only snagged two Black Orchestras on an early <a href=\"/en/card/11050\">Ark Lockdown</a>.  Val ran smart, got all set up with money and a pretty huge Turning Wheel, and there was nowhere to hide at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Game #3 (loss) vs. Stealth Jesminder:  I didn't ice up HQ first turn, and Jesminder managed to Hot Pursuit x2, and Dirty Laundry HQ turn 1.  The economy lead let her get set up before I could get scoring, and the ice suite was not enough to stop her (Switchblade Pelangi combo was very strong).  Film Critic canceled Punitive and kept me from getting my SSL credits.</p>\n\n<p>Game #4 (win) vs. Los:  Runner was running pretty standard good-stuff Criminal.  The deck worked as planned and they ran into Mwanza on R&amp;D, and hit a Snare! and Sapper with just Amina installed.  After that I managed to run away with scoring out.</p>\n\n<p>Strategies:  I usually throw the big taxing ice on the remote, and use wimpier stuff on centrals.  Money up early then just score out.  Sapper can sometimes be used to ice up, especially to score early (Sapper in front of Border Control is pretty good) but can just as often sit in hand.  Keeping the Sappers in the deck to be hit during a Mwanza run is the real plan--mulligan if there are any in hand, except in extreme circumstances.  After a Mwanza run, you can use Punitive or Wake Up Call to punish the Runner even further.  Wake Up Call can be used even when the Runner trashes Snare! or Sapper, and it can do a lot of work breaking expensive hardware or annoying resources (trash. the. film. critic.).</p>\n\n<p>Changes:  I think the agenda suite might need some refining; I like the Atlases and they have won me quite a few games online searching for Punitives, but scoring 7 points can be awkward.  The deck might be strictly better with no Atlases, and including <a href=\"/en/card/10094\">Consulting Visit</a> instead, to find Punitive, Wake Up Call, or even Too Big to Fail.  In addition, <a href=\"/en/card/26054\">Increased Drop Rates</a> is a cute card, especially for poisoning Archives, but it's a little inconsistent and doesn't do as much work as I would hope.  I think <a href=\"/en/card/26057\">Roughneck Repair Squad</a> does fine removing bad pub on its own between scoring.  Also, Preemptive Action is just a little too slow in this rushy sort of archetype, so I would drop that for another Tithonium, Border Control, or even an <a href=\"/en/card/26058\">Afshar</a> to make your defenses more consistent.  Preemptive seems good in theory to throw Snares and Sappers back into R&amp;D, but really one nasty Mwanza is all you need to pull ahead and stay ahead.\nI would try:</p>\n\n<p>-2 Atlas</p>\n\n<p>+1 Hostile Takeover</p>\n\n<p>+1 SSL</p>\n\n<p>-2 Increased Drop Rates</p>\n\n<p>+1 Snare!</p>\n\n<p>+1 Consulting Visit</p>\n\n<p>-1 Preemptive Action</p>\n\n<p>+1 Tithonium</p>\n\n<p>Try that or other combinations and let me know how it works!</p>\n", "user_id": 32441, "user_name": "dnddmdb", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11050": 2, "11060": 2, "11078": 2, "11080": 1, "11098": 3, "12098": 1, "21019": 2, "21038": 2, "21080": 2, "21096": 2, "22050": 1, "22056": 3, "23054": 2, "25079": 1, "25091": 2, "25116": 1, "25124": 1, "25126": 2, "25133": 3, "25138": 2, "25146": 3, "26054": 2, "26056": 3, "26057": 2, "26060": 2, "07027": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56932": {"id": 56932, "date_creation": "2019-09-08T16:51:44+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-20T20:19:46+00:00", "name": "Le Professionnel (1st place, 4-2 @ Colorado Regional)", "description": "<p>In a nutshell, this is a Gabe: Consummate Professional deck that runs 3x En Passant (which is a French word, hence the deck name). This deck won the 2019 Colorado Regionals, going 4-2 (including 2-0 in the top cut). This deck runs early and often. I don\u2019t actually think it\u2019s all that powerful of a deck, but wow is it fun to play! It feels like old school run-based crim.</p>\n\n<p><img data-src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/tgfSxa9uYx6E0/giphy.gif\" alt=\"Le Professionnel\" /></p>\n\n<p>I originally wanted to create a Perfume Shop style deck that could hammer HQ repeatedly and make money while doing do. Unfortunately, I don't think Pheremones is good enough in the current meta game. But you know what is good? Ice destruction. So the idea behind this deck was to build an ice destruction criminal that could trash HQ ice and then run HQ all day.</p>\n\n<p>However, the best ice destruction cards in the game cost too much influence. Hippo is super powerful, but it\u2019s 5 influence. Cutlery is great, but you either need to run multiples of each, or a Pelangi to give the ice the right subtype, and all that influence really starts to add up. But then I noticed that En Passant is only 2 influence, plus it combos well with Leave No Trace, Emergency Shutdown, and Inside Job. DONE.</p>\n\n<p>And here\u2019s another surprisingly good ice destruction card: Kyuban! It\u2019s amazing how often the corp trashes a piece of ice with a Kyuban on it. Especially if it\u2019s on HQ and you\u2019re already making money back from Gabe\u2019s ability. And ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s Weyland and they\u2019ve already given you some bad pub. The best part about Kyuban as an ice destruction card is that the corp spends the click to trash their own ice! YES PLEASE.</p>\n\n<p>The core economy of this deck is Paragon and Security Testing. It\u2019s a surprisingly solid econ engine. Mulligan for these cards. Paragon + Security Testing + Kyuban + Dirty Laundry + Gabe\u2019s ability will give you enough money. If the corp locks you out of all servers early to prevent your Sec Testing runs, you either need to slap down a Kyuban on some ice or En Passant/Emergency Shutdown the ice. AND KEEP. ON. RUNNING.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend face-planting into ice early and often with this deck. Keep the corp poor by forcing them to rez ice, and/or DOF-ing them. Emergency Shutdown the ice if they rez it. En Passant the ice if they don\u2019t. However, I didn\u2019t face much Jinteki in this tournament, so I\u2019ll admit that I would have been much less confident about face-planting into ice if it might have been a Cortex Lock, Aiki, Anansi, etc. But who cares-JUST DO IT! Turn 1 run HQ\u2026.ALWAYS! Ok, maybe not always\u2026.</p>\n\n<p>Some people might say that this deck doesn\u2019t have enough multi-access (just the 2 Turning Wheels). Some people might even say that I won my games in the top cut by luck-sacking my single accesses. But those people don\u2019t realize how much I practice my single accesses when I\u2019m at home. They don\u2019t realize how good I am at single-accessing. Just kidding! To those that say this deck doesn\u2019t have enough multi-access, I would argue that you trade off a ton of multi-access for a LOT more single accesses, because you\u2019re running all the time and getting paid to do so (or drawing cards with John Masanori). You can often hit HQ and R&amp;D each once a turn for single accesses, and I think those are pretty good odds of finding agendas! And besides, if you do get a Turning Wheel up and running, that's really all you need in this deck.</p>\n\n<p>Other important includes in this deck:</p>\n\n<p>2x of each breaker \u2013 I\u2019m tired of seeing Aumakua and Engolo everywhere! I miss that powerful feeling that you get when you have your Fracter, Decoder, and Killer all on the table in front of you. So I\u2019m bringing it back! But that means you need 2x of each, plus 2x Special Order to ensure that you get them all out in a reasonable amount of time.</p>\n\n<p>3x Embezzle \u2013 WOW what a card! I originally had this as a 2x, but it does soooo much work that I went to 3x. It\u2019s especially good in this deck because of how cheap it is to run HQ with Gabe\u2019s ability and the Kyubans. I would play this card even if it didn\u2019t give you the money for the trashes.</p>\n\n<p>1x Film Critic and 1x Hostage \u2013 Because Film Critic wins games. Hostage for it if you need it, and if not, use the hostage to get out Johnny Mass.</p>\n\n<p>Other considerations:</p>\n\n<p>-I think Fisk Investment Seminar would be good in this deck. Card draw is a little light, so Fisk would help with that. Plus, Fisk would help in those situations where HQ is wide open, but the corp has an impenetrable Surveyor remote and they\u2019re just waiting for an agenda to jam in there. Maybe swap The Class Act for Fisks?</p>\n\n<p>-I would also consider going up to 3x Kyuban. Maybe cut 1 Turning Wheel to get the influence, and swap out 1 or 2 of the run events for some Legworks to make up for the lack of the second Turning Wheel.</p>\n\n<p>-I'd also consider finding room for 1x Kati, for those times where you can't get your run-based econ engine up and running. Plus, you could Hostage for Kati.</p>\n\n<p>Bonne course tout le monde!\n(French for \u201cHappy running everyone!\u201d, at least according to Google Translate. But I should really know this, as I took 8 years of French in high school and college\u2026..Apologies to my French speakers if I butchered that.

I knew I wanted to play Eddie Kim, and the deck went through a couple of evolutions.  It started out running one <a href=\"/en/card/25031\">of</a> <a href=\"/en/card/02107\">each</a> <a href=\"/en/card/07044\">Interface</a> (my only regret is that Preemptive Action cannot feel my hate).  It turns out Archives Interface is just too slow.</p>\n\n<p>I then took some inspiration from @HiddenAway's <a href=\"/en/decklist/56298\">Enter MAWHAMMER</a>, and Maw really does work well with multiaccess/Kim.  After some testing, using the Conspiracy suite is just so inefficient against big ice.  With some advice from @Subtric, I decided to swap out <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a> for <a href=\"/en/card/08067\">Gang Sign</a> as my restricted card, which is a lot of fun in this deck.</p>\n\n<p>With no Paperclip, I changed up the breaker suite and dropped <a href=\"/en/card/06073\">Inject</a>, and <a href=\"/en/card/26005\">Utae</a> was relatively easy to incorporate into the deck.</p>\n\n<p>Once you get set up, Gang Sign, Bhagat, and Maw just wreak havoc on the Corp.  I think No One Home and Fencer Fueno are underrated, and have done a decent amount of work in my matchups.  Divide and Conquer is your secret weapon that can give you a lot of accessing/trashing power.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the deck is just too inconsistent; I had a hard time getting my breakers out.  Games went as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Game #1 (loss) vs. Gagarin: Played against the <a href=\"/en/decklist/56658\">typical good Gagarin</a>.  Got tagged up early on with HHN (was just a credit or two short of avoiding with <a href=\"/en/card/21045\">No One Home</a>.  Managed to snipe all the High-Profile Targets with Eddie Kim, but lost to Urban Renewals when I couldn't keep up.</p>\n\n<p>Game #2 (win) vs. NEH:  Didn't have much time for the game because the first game had gone on long, so I figured I just needed to snag a few points before time was up.  I ran like crazy, checking the remotes and centrals when I could.  I managed  to snag 7 points despite having 8 tags.</p>\n\n<p>Game #3 (loss) vs. Saraswati: I realized this was the <a href=\"/en/decklist/56796\">decklist of the week</a> but couldn't get set up fast enough to stop them as they started their Nisei train.</p>\n\n<p>Game #4 (loss) vs. The Outfit:  This was a rigshooter deck, basically the one matchup I was very worried about.  I lost Corroder early on to Trebuchet, then lost Na'Not'K and my other Corroder as meat damage to Contract Killer.  Past that I was pretty much locked out.</p>\n\n<p>Changes:  The deck needs some more consistency.  I think I would drop Aumakua and add another one of each breaker, maybe dropping Bhagat and Stimhack.  Alternatively, I might drop Aumakua and one Turning Wheel and add in Special Order or Clone Chip.  Or, adding back in the Conspiracy Breakers and Inject might be the right move.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone gets this thing to work, I'd love to hear about it!</p>\n", "user_id": 32441, "user_name": "dnddmdb", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10085": 2, "10098": 1, "12002": 2, "12088": 2, "12104": 1, "21045": 2, "21103": 2, "22002": 1, "25007": 1, "25010": 2, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25031": 1, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "26005": 2, "26007": 1, "03053": 3, "07028": 1, "07032": 3, "07055": 3, "08021": 3, "08067": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56910": {"id": 56910, "date_creation": "2019-09-07T10:26:39+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-17T09:47:23+00:00", "name": "Run economy Kit v2", "description": "<p>slight changes to the original found here:\nhttps://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/55434/run-economy-kit-1st-utrecht-sc- because I found in some cases I could make use of these interchanged cards.</p>\n", "user_id": 32699, "user_name": "DL7RRK", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"03028": 1, "07039": 1, "03038": 1, "25007": 2, "03046": 3, "11085": 1, "25060": 2, "21087": 2, "22019": 1, "11030": 1, "21006": 3, "25043": 3, "12026": 1, "03037": 1, "03049": 3, "08086": 2, "25059": 3, "26027": 1, "03048": 1, "21108": 3, "25050": 2, "21026": 1, "11063": 1, "11109": 3, "22020": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56911": {"id": 56911, "date_creation": "2019-09-07T15:30:02+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-09T14:15:19+00:00", "name": "Azhop (5-1 SOCRX)", "description": "<p>This deck went undefeated in SOCRX Swiss, and lost in a nailbiter in the first round of the cut.

OG deck here. https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/56727/thimbloop-1st-aarhus-regionals-</p>\n\n<p>Our meta is stalled on life support; three people at the Regional today. This deck got me the win by taking down 60 card MaxX and Hayley. </p>\n\n<p>Scarcity was the MVP vs Hayley. The game was long and drawn out. I tried to sneak out a Nisei behind a single Border Control early in the game. He Falsified the agenda, slammed Gauss, and grabbed the Nisei. Then he got an Obo, and I felt the game slipping away. Thankfully, I drew all three Scarcity and kept his resources-base econ cards in hand. He didn't fire a single Hayley install all game due to the lack of cash. Ultimately, the Gauss that got him the Nisei early ended up being his undoing against Data Loops, which were 5 to break plus 2 cards. I was able to score an Nisei behind a couple of Border Controls, an Obo before he could find Film Critic, and finally a Yagi-Uda with a Marcus Batty protecting it. Though it won me the game, I'll be happy when Scarcity and the other currents go out of fashion. </p>\n\n<p>Second game against MaxX was much rushier. I scored a Nisei and a Yagi-Uda pretty quickly, he snagged a Nisei, but MaxX kept trashing his breakers. He was finally able to get a Turtle back (clone chip, I think, but I had a Yagi-Uda behind Excalibur / Border Control combo and the Turtle didn't have any counters. I got the agendas in the order and spacing I needed; if that game goes much longer, I think the Turtle runs roughshod all over me. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @ElderMason and @KingTilt  / BSNGNR for playing and keeping the game alive here in KC.

So we did a round-robin style for our  tournament. </p>\n\n<p>Leela won against Outfit that was imitation Skorp - Batty and Trojan for rig-shooting, and Ark Lockdown to banish things forever. I stole a couple of agendas early, and bounced ice back from RD. I was down to the last click and had a bunch of bucks on Kati. Little did I know that that my opponent was going to Trojan Horse and Ark Lock my only decoder away, effectively locking me out of the game unless I took the bucks or won that turn. Because I am too aggressive for my own good, I ran RD last click, not even thinking about the Trojan menace. Luckily for me, there was an SDS on RD, and I trashed my own Engolo for the win.

You kinda forget about the current meta things, forget about rotated cards, keep wanting to jam new cards into your decks.</p>\n\n<p>So I called upon the assistance of my playtest team, and the kind folks of #UK in stimslack, and decided upon an Argus with my typical stupid jank addition (Psychic Field, went 2-3 on the day and I probably shouldn't have taken Argus when this out of practice) and that I was definitely going to be playing Leela.</p>\n\n<p>During a great chat with @paulyg about Leela lists and his current test list, I was reminded of an old version of my take on Waltz Leela from back in 2016: https://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/33107/the-pragmatic-soul-top-4-rockingham-west-aus-sc-</p>\n\n<p>Excalibur is around right now, Hunting Grounds is great tech again IP Block, my list already had 2x Datasucker, and folks have been playing around singleton Engolos a lot lately. Also Amina is fantastic and being able to play it while still having AI support is excellent, so why not bring back my favourite Icebreaker in the game and play Atman?</p>\n\n<p>The rest of the list is pretty standard. NOH, Bank Job, Critic and Hunting Grounds as tech cards. I skipped Caldera because I wasn't too scared of grind and NOH can suffice for just not dying to big chunks of net damage. Embezzle is amazing and I felt great every time I played it. Falsified also saved my bacon on multiple occasions. Blueberry Diesel is definitely underrated, and combined with Paragon and TCA this deck has a tremendous amount of filtering ability to the point that I often felt really good spending a click to draw a card that was exactly something I wanted.</p>\n\n<p>Every game with the deck felt great, almost electric. Was just a constant gameplan of laying down pressure and then keeping it up until I had enough of a tempo lead to rebuild my board back up and prepare for the corp's next moves.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I was super pleased with the list, though I did kinda regret cutting Kati in my game during the cut against an RP. Not sure what I would've cut for it though, as I felt the rest of my tech choices were too important to skip on, but it's absolutely a consideration for next time I play with it.</p>\n", "user_id": 14102, "user_name": "Anzekay", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10085": 2, "11008": 2, "21045": 1, "21064": 2, "21084": 2, "21104": 2, "21105": 3, "21106": 3, "25010": 2, "25011": 2, "25021": 1, "25026": 2, "25032": 2, "25038": 1, "25051": 1, "25059": 3, "25060": 3, "26012": 3, "26016": 2, "26018": 2, "03053": 3, "05048": 1, "08086": 1, "09035": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56849": {"id": 56849, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T06:45:04+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-01T14:58:46+00:00", "name": "Psyargus", "description": "<p><em>published by AlwaysBeRunning.net</em></p>\n", "user_id": 14102, "user_name": "Anzekay", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 1, "11016": 2, "11040": 3, "11080": 1, "11097": 3, "12058": 1, "12098": 1, "21036": 3, "21039": 2, "21057": 1, "21080": 3, "21119": 2, "22056": 2, "23054": 3, "25112": 3, "25124": 3, "25126": 3, "25130": 1, "25133": 2, "25146": 3, "26058": 1, "05010": 2, "07001": 1, "09026": 3}, "mwl_code": null}, "56850": {"id": 56850, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T07:09:20+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-01T07:11:13+00:00", "name": "Reduce, Renew, Recycle (v2) - 5th in Vienna", "description": "<p>for ABR claim purpose</p>\n", "user_id": 15340, "user_name": "Krasty", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10017": 2, "10050": 3, "10095": 3, "11060": 2, "11080": 3, "11118": 1, "12113": 3, "21014": 3, "21018": 2, "21033": 3, "21060": 1, "21080": 3, "25086": 1, "25090": 2, "25139": 1, "05007": 3, "06083": 3, "06105": 1, "06106": 3, "08014": 2, "08034": 1, "08040": 3, "08113": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56851": {"id": 56851, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T07:10:46+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-10T00:03:34+00:00", "name": "Apoc Alice (v2) - 5th in Viena", "description": "<p>for ABR claim purpose</p>\n", "user_id": 15340, "user_name": "Krasty", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"11024": 3, "11042": 3, "11081": 3, "12061": 1, "12104": 2, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "26004": 3, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "06100": 1, "07032": 3, "07035": 3, "07036": 1, "07044": 1, "08021": 3, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56852": {"id": 56852, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T08:18:29+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-01T09:21:09+00:00", "name": "Die Korporativ Leela", "description": "<p>Nothing special to see here.

Not because one of the players did something really exciting or interesting in order to win, but because they were the safer player and managed to \"not lose\" for the longest.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Brett and Co at Knightly Games for hosting the event and all my opponents for the matches, always a pleasure to see everyone there!</p>\n", "user_id": 14584, "user_name": "just_rob", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10054": 3, "10094": 2, "10111": 3, "11016": 2, "11080": 3, "12036": 1, "21018": 3, "21036": 2, "21038": 3, "21080": 3, "21119": 2, "22052": 2, "23054": 1, "25108": 2, "25127": 2, "25133": 1, "26056": 3, "06028": 2, "06071": 1, "06083": 2, "06106": 3, "07002": 1, "08118": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56854": {"id": 56854, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T09:11:03+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-01T14:32:08+00:00", "name": "\"Images\" of another Wu 1st Lanark Regional (5-0)", "description": "<p>I made some very minor tweaks to the previous Wu list I published, I anticipated there to be a good chunk of Gagarin (There was) and also some of the new NEH that has been seeing play (There was none).  </p>\n\n<p>From the previous list I removed the cards that I had played the least to see what I could replace them with: Cy Cy, Ika Feedback Filter and Akamatsu.

Your game plan is jamming agendas to get to game point, then close out the game with a neat gimmick of Mason Bellamy, Border Control and/or Ikawah Project, all three of which pressure the Runner's clicks and allow you to set up some nasty puzzles with a bit of work, occasyionally accomplishing the rare feat of actually scoring against a Runner with breakers and money in 2019. </p>\n\n<p>An example is a 3-iced server with Mason Bellamy and Border Control, meaning that a normal Runner is going to run click 1, lose a click on each ice, and then be Border Controlled out. Oops. Or maybe there's no Border Control, but the agenda you're scoring is Ikawah and therefore unstealable if Mason's around. Or maybe you have Heinlein Grid + Mason Bellamy, effectively forcing the Runner to run last click. But if so, Border Control just shuts you out.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, most Runners have tricks of their own, with Apocalypse, Hippo, Beth and Surfer all potentially messing with your plan. I think you have some game all of them, largely on the back of Border Control being such a potent effect, but I haven't really tested enough to say (why risk losing a <em>90% WIN RATE?!</em>). So far, most of my games have been against people who seemed to be caught unaware by the gimmick, which obviously makes things easier. I suspect that if the Runner knows what's up and is proactive about clearing out your remote, things get significantly harder.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, there's not much to say, except that I've been a lot happier about Asa than I thought. This deck started out as a Sportsmetal deck, then became a Seidr deck when I thought Mason would let me recur Border Controls, then became Asa for want of a better option when I ended up only ever triggering my ID on Ikawah steals. This let me go to 3x Blue Level Clearance, as BLC (and Rashida) forces you into mildly awkward turns if you don't want to discard cards, but Asa often fixes that. It also lets you IAA Ikawah while throwing in a Mason or Border Control, which is niche but pretty strong.</p>\n", "user_id": 2029, "user_name": "presheaf", "tournament_badge": false, "cards": {"10037": 2, "11049": 3, "21009": 1, "21010": 3, "21080": 3, "22027": 1, "23054": 3, "25068": 3, "25073": 3, "25076": 2, "25077": 1, "25079": 2, "25080": 1, "25081": 3, "25083": 3, "25100": 2, "25143": 2, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "26035": 2, "06023": 2, "06061": 2}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3.1"}, "56861": {"id": 56861, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T21:17:46+00:00", "date_update": "2019-11-17T02:01:19+00:00", "name": "Smashing Eddie (1st @ Dublin Regionals)", "description": "<p>This is a destruction deck built around smashing everything with <a href=\"/en/card/09030\">Apocalypse</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/10001\">Run Amok</a>, <a href=\"/en/card/11061\">En Passant</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/07028\">Eddie Kim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Draw cards and make money with Gamble / Fair / Liberated / Casts / Earthrise / Inject engine, while keeping en eye on what the corp is up to. If they don't protect centrals properly, Apocalypse them with help from DDoS and Run Amok, which usually give a free run on centrals where Eddie can smash things before the Apocalypse comes. Horizontal decks are further punished by 3x <a href=\"/en/card/08021\">Hacktivist Meeting</a> to smash things from hand.</p>\n\n<p>This Eddie often uses his face as an icebreaker when Running Amok, so before starting to do that, it's good to keep an <a href=\"/en/card/07032\">I've Had Worse</a> in hand to stop you from dying and have some money in the pocket to shake off tags. If the corp doesn't rez ice when Running Amok, smash a card from that server and then En Passant the ice. DDoS and En Passant also work nicely together, giving Eddie access to smash things from servers and then smashing the ice away as well. </p>\n\n<p>The bin breakers are there mainly as a backup and often don't get used at all, and even when they do, it's usually just once to allow smashing everything with Apocalypse, so their inefficiency (except for <a href=\"/en/card/11024\">Paperclip</a>) doesn't matter too much.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/26006\">Climactic Showdown</a> was a last minute include to test it, and it felt quite good, either complementing the smashing game plan by clearing ice from a server, or giving multiaccess for more guaranteed server smashing or closing out the game. I also like how the multiaccess it gives can be followed by a surprise <a href=\"/en/card/10083\">Rebirth</a> into <a href=\"/en/card/11043\">Omar</a> to deep dig a central server. The same card slot was previously a <a href=\"/en/card/21107\">Reclaim</a> to recur DDoS, hence the 2 unused influence.</p>\n\n<p>Glacier decks can be tricky to deal with, especially if they have early access to Jinja City Grid and a lot of ice. If a glacier deck gets set up, often the best option is to Rebirth into Omar to make Apocalypse easier. Alternatively you can focus on stripping ice from R&amp;D with Run Amok and En Passant and try to win the game from R&amp;D. Eddie's ability acts as a pseudo-multiaccess, allowing smashing through operations to find the agendas.</p>\n\n<p>This deck helped me to first place at Dublin Regionals, going undefeated in four games. Apocalypse fired only three times during the day and not at all in a couple of games, showing that the deck doesn't completely rely on it. I think this deck works quite well in the current meta where the corps play relatively little central ice, but would probably struggle in a more glaciery meta.</p>\n", "user_id": 21980, "user_name": "DoubleK", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10083": 1, "11024": 2, "11042": 2, "11061": 3, "11081": 2, "25006": 3, "25017": 3, "25022": 3, "25059": 3, "25063": 3, "26006": 1, "03053": 3, "06073": 3, "07028": 1, "07032": 3, "07036": 1, "08021": 3, "08103": 3, "09030": 3}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}, "56862": {"id": 56862, "date_creation": "2019-09-01T21:18:16+00:00", "date_update": "2019-09-10T21:07:28+00:00", "name": "Gangster Takeover (1st @ Dublin Regionals)", "description": "<p>This is a balls to the wall rush deck that likes to go fast and make big risky moves, which puts the runner in front of tough choices early before they are set up. It uses a mix of gearcheck ice and big <a href=\"/en/card/05015\">Mushin</a> plays to score fast, backed up by a kill threat with <a href=\"/en/card/04079\">Punitive Counterstrike</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/01069\">Project Junebug</a>. It creates really fast, fun and intense games!</p>\n\n<p>Phase one of the game plan is to score a <a href=\"/en/card/01094\">Hostile Takeover</a> as soon as possible. If you don't get it in starting hand, find it with <a href=\"/en/card/05027\">Fast Track</a> and throw a piece of gearcheck ice on HQ to score it on turn 2. <a href=\"/en/card/10094\">Consulting Visit</a> helps in fast tracking it early.</p>\n\n<p>Phase two is to start Mushining out things to really put the pressure on. One of my favourite plays is to Fast Track a <a href=\"/en/card/07006\">Government Takeover</a> to hand and then Mushin out either that or a Junebug, sometimes slapping a gearcheck ice in front of it. Usually at this point the runner will start worrying about Punitive Counterstrike. If the runner doesn't go get it, advancing it to six really turns up the heat, especially when it happens on turns 3-5. Mushin into <a href=\"/en/card/21078\">City Works Project</a> is also a nice way to put the pressure on threaten a Punitive kill. Sometimes you can also just win by rushing behind gearcheck ice or get a kill with install-advance-advance Junebug bluff behind a gearcheck. People don't seem to expect that out of The Outfit.</p>\n\n<p>The ice is cheap and not taxing at all, so bad publicity doesn't really matter. The ice has been selected to just keep the runner out for a few turns with different ice types and present a couple of extra challenges to slow them down :</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/04096\">Wraparound</a> = Go find a fracter or some shenanigans</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/05024\">Guard</a> = End the run sentry, no Inside Jobs, Logic Bombs or Security Nexus please</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/01111\">Enigma</a> = Lose time if you just face check</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/card/06010\">Mother Goddess</a> = Go find an AI or some other shenanigans</p>\n\n<p>This deck really doesn't like Film Critic, so 2x <a href=\"/en/card/22057\">Under the Bus</a> with 3x <a href=\"/en/card/10094\">Consulting Visit</a> is a must. It also makes me like to see the runner play Kati Jones, because it usually just slows them down and often ends up under the bus at some point.</p>\n\n<p>The 3x <a href=\"/en/card/01098\">Beanstalk Royalties</a> is probably the most flexible slot and I've used <a href=\"/en/card/21120\">False Flag</a> and <a href=\"/en/card/21119\">High-Profile Target</a> in those slots instead sometimes, which has also worked quite well.</p>\n\n<p>This deck helped me to first place in Dublin Regionals with 3 wins and a timed loss. The games were really fun and intense, with some epic moments involving Government Takeover and Mushin. If you like decks that play fast and give an adrenaline rush, it's worth giving this a spin.</p>\n", "user_id": 21980, "user_name": "DoubleK", "tournament_badge": true, "cards": {"10094": 3, "21038": 2, "21078": 2, "22050": 1, "22056": 3, "22057": 2, "25079": 2, "25089": 2, "25116": 3, "25124": 2, "25136": 3, "25138": 3, "25143": 3, "25146": 3, "25147": 3, "05015": 3, "05024": 3, "05027": 3, "06010": 2, "07006": 1, "08039": 1}, "mwl_code": "standard-mwl-3-3"}}
